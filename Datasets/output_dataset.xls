hey guys im forking an apache 20 licensed github repository i want to ensure that i properly credit the original authors this project has been dead for several years not so long ago one dev has resurrected it but hes very busy and i think that this project fills a very big void in the community and that active development of this project would be of great benefit to the community the original project ha copyright commentsnotices on top of some of its files to properly differentiate between original work and my work i would like to ensure all source code files contain this those that are unmodified i only want to leave the original copyright notice those that are entirely new just my copyright notice and those that are mixed get both one thing is that the original copyright notice reads as follows copyright 20002017 jetbrains sro it is 20002017 but there were changes made since however no one updated the original copyright notices do you guys think its fine if i bump the copyright to include 2024 since today is the day that im officially starting this fork,2024-12-26T13:41:52.816000+00:00,Luky,Discord,Jobs and Hiring,0.9907,Positive,0,Positive

 chatgpt sometimes writes plausiblesounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers fixing this issue is challenging as 1 during rl training theres currently no source of truth chatgpt is an improvement to gpt that keeps better locality it provides 0 guarantees of accuracy or consistency and is not intended to generate information in an educational context you need to have the skill to identify when it is correct or incorrect ie know the answer to get utility out of it it helped me it can definitely generate helpful responses it can also just as well generate nonsensical responses with made up terms the issue is that telling the difference requires knowing the answer already making its utility as such a tool dubious at best unlike something like a simple web search or another human you do not get a way to gauge confidence or get alternative responses to compare and contrast against for example try to identify whats incorrect in the code explanation on the above blogpost it will keep getting better speculating on what distinct products in the future may offer is a different discussion unrelated to if this product is acceptable to be used to learn anything and implicitly acknowledges it is not currently in such a state additionally there are more caveats on its current behavior listed on the above blog post than the one quoted above gpt4 and future versions are unlikely to fix these problems without significant advancement in the field as these issues are largely inherent to the use of language learning models llms generally and not specifically openais products note that we do not currently allow generating answers to community questions using chatgpt or another automated tool as per rule 17 and ,2024-12-22T15:12:34.546000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.9854,Positive,0,Positive

its extremely easy for anyone to put anything they want as the from address in an email because of how email works the term email spoofing is usually referring to exactly that someone intentionally falsifying the sender information id bet good money that your email address happens to be on a list of 100s or 1000s of other addresses which some scammer put to a program that sends the template automatically and changes the from to be the same as the to theres a good chance the person who sent it didnt even see your email address with their own eyes they just downloaded the list and ran the program the reason why its so simple is because the way email works at the serverprotocol level really hasnt changed much from the way it worked back in the very early days of the internet when everyone using it either knew each other directly or through only a few degrees of separation security wasnt even a thing people thought about they were still trying to figure out if theyd be able to use it outside of the universities they worked at,2024-12-22T01:00:34.511000+00:00,xxx>馃<xxx,Discord,General Discussion,0.9134,Positive,0,Positive

help with implementing elasticsearch for multilingual english arabic pdf search hi all im currently working on integrating elasticsearch into my python application this is my first attempt at using elasticsearch so id really appreciate some guidance what ive done so far 1 pdf processing hardcoded a folder from which my program fetches all pdf files iterates through each file extracting text page by page 2 data embedding embedded the text pagewise and stored both the text and its embedding in elasticsearch along with metadata like filename and page number 3 query handling when a query is entered its embedded and matched against the uploaded content to retrieve relevant data along with page numbers this setup is working well for english i also plan to enhance the search functionality to handle both textbased and embeddingbased queries in the future but for now im focusing on embeddings current challenge i want to extend this functionality to handle arabic pdfs allowing queries in either english or arabic to yield accurate results for example a user uploads an hr policy document in arabic they then query paternity leaves in english and the system should retrieve the relevant content or page number roadblock without any modifications i tried uploading an arabic document and querying in arabic but the results are poor less than 10 accuracy i added an arabic analyzer to the index mapping following elasticsearch documentation but the results are still inaccurate additional context my index is very basic since i only started this yesterday below are the links i referred to while setting this up elasticsearch language analyzers semantic search with nlp elasticsearch geeksforgeeks ill also link the model im using for embeddings below would love to hear suggestions on improving my current index setup for arabic handling crosslingual search eg querying in english for arabic content,2024-12-18T18:35:25.799000+00:00,Breather,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.888,Positive,0,Positive

rust took me 4 weeks of hating the language until it suddenly klicked for me its not even the borrow checker thats a nice gimmic but the type system especially the rust enums are just so expressive whats even better are the people using it theyre extremely nice and helpful in my experience and since most of them have at least decent programming experience the code quality is surprisingly high overall i just feel like its a great language to structure your data and really express yourself,2024-12-16T22:22:05.824000+00:00,acul009,Discord,AI and Tools,0.9753,Positive,0,Positive

to be completely fair chasing after finding purpose is kinda selfdefeating in a way because any feelings of purpose come from within not from something external you cant exactly find it laying on the floor somewhere it kinda comes naturally over time as you get more experiences and understand yourself better over many years and yes you can speedrun it in a sense but that often experience many extreme experiences in your life both good and bad and it is often a rather demanding process if one does that,2024-12-13T09:41:35.162000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.0891,Neutral,0,Positive

its like a central hub for memes people will upload images 1 image goes through embedding model image vector stored in a vector db 2 image is also fed to an multimodal llm that checks if theres any text on the image extracts it and runs that text through a text embedding model this vector is also stored in the vector db now when new memes are uploaded it will find the closest meme based on the imagetext if its too similar then it will not allow the meme upload and they can leave a comment under it instead so people can connect through esoteric memeage,2024-12-10T22:38:08.025000+00:00,dndrsn,Discord,Human Interaction,0.1615,Positive,0,Positive

depends on the queries how often do you need those columns and logic how these columns will change to hold it in separate database will increase scalability technically but probably so little that you wont notice for a few columns in this context probably separate database is overengineering it would be better to store in the separate table but in the same database and it will also scale like that same table id email password age separate for roles separate for profession separate for subscription status there probably you will want to do some grouping filtering logic etc scanning will be faster for a table with less columns its called vertical partitioning depending on queries count complexity and how much data there is it could be split even more,2024-12-04T20:50:29.565000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.8481,Positive,0,Positive

 its better than ts if your build system needs to be performant and the time you save from ts transpilation is worth it considering all code gets transpiled to a builddist file this play no role in anything unless you are litetally talking the development time it takes to transpile to see the changes which is minimal unless you are developing on a literal potato,2024-09-26T22:09:00.743000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Human Interaction,0.8201,Positive,0,Positive
jsdoc is cumbersome because it pollutes your code with gigantic lines of comments its better than ts if your build system needs to be performant and the time you save from ts transpilation is worth it,2024-09-26T21:05:41.506000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Human Interaction,0.5859,Positive,0,Positive

honestly the sole need for authentication is to actual users stored in the db and to link the purchase records to their accounts most probably they wont even come back to the website they will just pay for the service and leave,2024-09-02T09:57:58.598000+00:00,kanpachi,Discord,Critical Thinking,0.34,Positive,0,Positive

you could have all users provide an email address and create an account based off that for logins you could email them a magic login link this way anyone who purchases anything will automatically have an account and repurchases will be put under the same account via email ive seen a couple sites do this and i think its pretty frictionless and user friendly just make sure to send an email after the purchase saying something like your account details at site with a login link make sure your magic login links should expire after a certain time,2024-09-02T09:53:01.927000+00:00,Tay,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving,0.9403,Positive,0,Positive

hello guys i am looking for some advice or maybe perspectives i am making a website using django the targeted audience is going to be mobile users basically the main flow looks like the user visits the website look at a bunch of info and clicks on the get started button and then go through a multi step form ive used django wizard formtools for this theres 5 steps in total and in the last step they will have to upload some documentation then gets redirected to the payment page and ive used stripe for this my issue is that my users could be authenticated or anonymous users ive used all auth for the authentication however if the users proceeds to pay as an anonymous user i am afraid that would result in a lot of clutter in my database since they are not registered users for this i thought i either have to force them to create an account right after the get started process but i feel its a bit less user friendly also if theyre registered this would help decrease the number of steps at the beginning of the process and i can store information about their payment or any information i need to store and if i allow them to carry on till the end without having an account im wondering to where redirect them after completing the process so the can see their payment invoice maybe other things i am a little bit confused,2024-09-01T17:54:35.144000+00:00,kanpachi,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.8689,Positive,0,Positive

im not sure what you are saying is switched up because i agree with what you said if the electromotive force is some voltage v the current that is pushed through is i v rload r proportional to v and the resistances hold the current back the voltage across the internal resistor is then vint i r v r rload r in opposition to v and so the total voltage of the battery is vab v rload rload r about the current measurements i am asking about the possibility that the leads of your ammeter are the wrong way around which would give a negative reading not whether you attached the battery in the opposite direction of the light emitting diode also wdym it was not current a but voltage v,2024-12-18T02:55:52.637000+00:00,Duck,Discord,Technology and Education,-0.4821,Negative,0,Negative
isnt it switched up voltage should push the current in ratio of the potencial between 2 end and resistance holds the current back nope i dont even need to measure cause if i put it as ll it wont light up but if i put it as ll and it was not current a but voltage v led as a resistor is fin imo in this use case i whish sheldon were real so i could ask him,2024-12-17T20:44:36.016000+00:00,Not your oppa,Discord,Jobs and Hiring,0.0,Neutral,0,Negative
after searching online its probably internal resistance shenanigans if they are old batteries they might have a reasonably high internal resistance and so when you are measuring the batteries voltage you are also measuring the internal resistance think of it like this a battery with internal resistance can be modelled as an ideal battery and a resistor in series when you apply the load to the battery you are increasing the current across the battery which was basically zero when measured with the multimeter this increases the voltage that the internal resistor is supplying in resistance to the batterys voltage and about the 010 and 040 current measurements idk is it possible that you were measuring current in the opposite direction also if you attach resistors of different known resistances as the load you could probably measure the modelled internal resistance also disclaimer i dont know electronics that well seen by how ive modelled the led below as a resistor bcs idk,2024-12-17T12:31:18.131000+00:00,Duck,Discord,General Discussion,0.7351,Positive,0,Negative

so i have 2 old 12v batteries when i measure them i get about 4v each but if i connect a led as a load it drops down to 2v each math checks out and everyting is fine then when i connect them in series i get 8v with no load but when i put the led there i get 2v again also i get like from 010 to 040 when i measure dc on old battery my teacher said that my dmm is bad cause otherwise i would have broken the laws physics but i have 2 dmm and both say the same so how do the voltage drops to 2 when the actual voltage should be 2 so 22 should be 4 can you have a negatively charged battery,2024-12-15T22:15:44.976000+00:00,Not your oppa,Discord,Products and Economics,-0.8573,Negative,0,Negative

i have a portable air conditioner and it sucks and i want to improve it i took took off the outer plastic casing now which parts should i insulate im thinking the pipe that goes out of the compressor to the cooling fins and then the part that is cooler that goes out of the cooling fins to the gas expansion part and into the cooling fins that cool the indoor air should i also insulate the hot pipes as to not leech heat into the cool pipes the compressor has some very poor insulation is insulating it with rockwool a good idea or is it dangerous will it overheat will make the vents that go out the window shorter and insulate those and somehow insulate the space between the the part that cools the gas and the part that cools the room is there anything else i should do or dont do inside its propane r290 in normal operation the lowest it goes is 17c i read propane at 1 bar pressure becomes liquid at 42c would it be safe to take the temperature sensor that measures the incoming air its right before the room air goes into the cooling fins and put it somewhere where its consistently hotter so maybe it will cool the room to 10c or something its a small room that i will additionally insulate,2024-06-15T11:23:35.860000+00:00,itrythissh13t,Discord,General Discussion,0.2748,Positive,0,Positive

isp or specific impulse shows how much of impulse ns or kgfs a rocket engine produces while burning one unit of mass of the propellant thus if you multiply the isp by the mass of propellant reaction mass used by the rocket engine you will get the thrust ispfdmdt where f is the force of thrust and dmdt is consumption of reaction mass per second isp can be measured in seconds if consumption of the reaction mass is measured in kilograms and the thrust is measured in kilogramsforce kgf if the force is in newtons n then the unit of isp is nskg if the consumption of the reaction mass is measured in pounds per second and the force is measured in poundsforce the unit of isp is still a second traditionally isp is reported in seconds and the exhaust velocity of the reaction mass of a rocket is 980665isp meters per second if isp is given in nskg then the exhaust velocity in ms is equal to isp isp of chemical rocket engines is typically between 260 and 360 seconds depending on the propellant components and design of the rocket engine some propellant components may provide isp up to 450 seconds but such components are rarely used for example if a rocket engine burns 200 kg of propellant each second and its isp is 300 seconds it produces the thrust of 600 kgf kilogramsforce or 5884 n,2022-04-26T17:05:02.358000+00:00,V.B.,Discord,Products and Economics,-0.296,Negative,0,Negative

to be honest youll end up getting clinical experience etc anyway if you go to med school but your training in the basic sciences is specific and within certain limits i think a lot of people especially people in healthcare either lack or can benefit from more basic science training yes even mds misinformation pseudoscience and medical errors arent new but the pandemic has shown me how many people fall for all that stuff an unfortunately thats even true for healthcare personnel who push antivax and other science contrarian positions,2023-12-23T07:43:17.144000+00:00,V.,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving,0.2846,Positive,0,Positive

noone directly in fact there is not that much use for people living right now besides maybe talking with satellites far away but it could teach us more about our universe which in many years might become useful but we dont know that yet it could accelerate us understanding the laws of physics and getting a more correct model of the universe which indirectly leads to new technologies and those in turn can help humanity but as you can see thats quite far already that is also why it it criticized a lot many people find that we should first focus on getting our stuff together here on earth that this funding that goes to things like radio astronomy or other research that doesnt directly help solve the problems we have now would better go to more urgent problems like climate change getting world peace or increasing production capacity so we can solve famine or poverty in general and seen the distance of the observations done in radio astronomy we can wait another 1000 years before we resume research likely much more efficient as well have better materials and better technology overall,2022-09-19T08:22:51.262000+00:00,screbuts,Discord,Modeling and Development,0.9798,Positive,0,Positive

so my suggestioninform your colleague that you will reach out to your professor with the excuse that amount of work you have to do alone if he doesnt cooperate is too big,2022-05-24T15:53:13.584000+00:00,GeoLek,Discord,General Discussion,-0.1531,Negative,0,Negative
definitely agree with that i used to think that reporting these kind of things to the professor would be bad for your colleagues but most of the time papers and homework is given based on the number of the people they will work on it if you work alone you will both have much more work to do and probably get a worse grade because of the fact that the work is given to more people,2022-05-24T15:52:07.626000+00:00,GeoLek,Discord,General Discussion,-0.705,Negative,0,Negative

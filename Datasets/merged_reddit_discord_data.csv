i am trying to learn fastapi i have found 3 good resources but i am not sure which to pick due to tradeoffs can someone please advise 1 freecodecamp    this one has a lot of good reviews like really good  only problem is that it is 3 years old i am afraid that stuff might be irrelevant now 2 freecodecamp    recent 5 months  havent seen reviews would it be better than the first one 3 ssali jonathan    recent 4 months  comprehensive  people say it is good but not as much reviews and good feedback as one,2024-12-30T17:26:07.358000+00:00,Wolverine,Discord,Modeling and Development

there is a side bar where i can click to each question,2024-12-30T04:00:04.567000+00:00,SP,Discord,Finance and Deals
are they not separated by newlines or some type of symbol,2024-12-30T03:55:29.789000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,AI and Tools
what stops you from seeing where one question starts and ends,2024-12-30T03:55:09.526000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Modeling and Development
like what do you mean can u elaborate,2024-12-30T03:52:56.578000+00:00,SP,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
thats my confusion is how theres no way to tell when one starts and ends,2024-12-30T03:52:20.975000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
thank you btw,2024-12-30T03:50:56.184000+00:00,SP,Discord,Exploration and Sharing
but not user questions,2024-12-30T03:50:45.269000+00:00,SP,Discord,Time and Productivity
no they are made by the company i think,2024-12-30T03:50:37.051000+00:00,SP,Discord,Work and Collaboration
these questions are custom made i guess not textbook,2024-12-30T03:50:20.512000+00:00,SP,Discord,Human Interaction
like submitted by the people using the product,2024-12-30T03:50:18.345000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Modeling and Development
what do you mean by user questions ,2024-12-30T03:49:49.580000+00:00,SP,Discord,Time and Productivity
are these user questions or are you ripping them out of textbooks,2024-12-30T03:49:29.313000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Time and Productivity
yes,2024-12-30T03:48:43.865000+00:00,SP,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
sure but if you want to automate it it will become very complicated if there is no agreed upon way to determine when a question start or stop,2024-12-30T03:48:14.811000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Human Interaction
find out idk,2024-12-30T03:47:34.942000+00:00,SP,Discord,General Discussion
i read it i guess,2024-12-30T03:47:25.793000+00:00,SP,Discord,Technology and Education
lets say they hand you a giant file how do you know where the question start or end,2024-12-30T03:46:20.784000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Human Interaction
honestly if you have a giant list already you can feed it into gpt or something and get reasonable accuracy,2024-12-30T03:45:48.333000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Modeling and Development
start simple and go from there it will help you see the limits how people use it what they actually need etc,2024-12-30T03:45:47.041000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Critical Thinking
so what would be actually understanding the document,2024-12-30T03:45:38.365000+00:00,SP,Discord,Finance and Deals
well ill try out google sheets,2024-12-30T03:45:23.185000+00:00,SP,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
yeah i guess so,2024-12-30T03:44:31.908000+00:00,SP,Discord,Finance and Deals
it still would remain potentially a very complicated task,2024-12-30T03:44:20.088000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Startups and Experience
maybe that could be the data,2024-12-30T03:43:37.668000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
but what if i used the previously completed questions i categorised,2024-12-30T03:43:27.713000+00:00,SP,Discord,Human Interaction
it can be a very complicated task,2024-12-30T03:42:58.866000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
but that needs alot of data right,2024-12-30T03:42:36.224000+00:00,SP,Discord,Personal Experiences
like if you see some spanish in quotes in a sentence i am pretty sure it wont be math and it will be cheaper than a llm,2024-12-30T03:42:33.134000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Startups and Experience
especially if categories are subjective,2024-12-30T03:42:03.784000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Personal Experiences
it depends,2024-12-30T03:41:50.787000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,General Discussion
classifying written language unironically sounds like a job for an llm no,2024-12-30T03:41:37.705000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Problem Solving
it means understanding the document,2024-12-30T03:41:33.114000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
like a brief description,2024-12-30T03:41:23.816000+00:00,SP,Discord,Finance and Deals
whats parse if i may ask,2024-12-30T03:41:18.021000+00:00,SP,Discord,Human Interaction
the main steps would be to parse and classify the questions,2024-12-30T03:40:59.638000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Modeling and Development
a database which is a fancier excel sheet,2024-12-30T03:40:46.489000+00:00,Maethor,Discord,Time and Productivity
but im just curious if there is any other way to complete this,2024-12-30T03:40:31.927000+00:00,SP,Discord,Company and Services
like google sheets is an option,2024-12-30T03:40:19.783000+00:00,SP,Discord,Finance and Deals
vaguely,2024-12-30T03:40:11.532000+00:00,SP,Discord,Work and Collaboration
but if i wanted to try and make something to do that what would i need to do,2024-12-30T03:40:08.914000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
hm okay,2024-12-30T03:39:46.704000+00:00,SP,Discord,Technical Discussions
the sheet itself can be filtered and sorted too,2024-12-30T03:39:08.819000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Time and Productivity
and anyone can just update the category,2024-12-30T03:38:58.358000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Products and Economics
and you put the questions in rows,2024-12-30T03:38:51.869000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Human Interaction
in the simplest form you can have two columns  category  question,2024-12-30T03:38:41.998000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Critical Thinking
since its online multiple people can look and edit spreadsheets at the same time,2024-12-30T03:38:21.290000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
yeah try it,2024-12-30T03:38:06.202000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Finance and Deals
no but i can try it out,2024-12-30T03:38:02.395000+00:00,SP,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
have you used google sheets,2024-12-30T03:37:48.696000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Finance and Deals
so some people could say they are subjective but then again when they proof check the documents i complete there is a wrong and right answer,2024-12-30T03:37:31.433000+00:00,SP,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
hm i see,2024-12-30T03:36:58.553000+00:00,SP,Discord,Problem Solving
if these categories are subjectives then you would not be able to classify them anyway,2024-12-30T03:36:52.085000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Modeling and Development
what if these categories are subjective does that affect anything,2024-12-30T03:36:34.059000+00:00,SP,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
and so all the information is already there and formatted and you can sort or filter it in any way you want,2024-12-30T03:36:25.174000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Modeling and Development
your friends dads and his team can put the questions along with metadata ex category in a spreadsheet,2024-12-30T03:36:03.792000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Problem Solving
how could they be used in this context,2024-12-30T03:35:21.994000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
spreadsheets are great for these cases,2024-12-30T03:34:53.544000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Personal Experiences
his team im guessing made them,2024-12-30T03:34:32.266000+00:00,SP,Discord,General Discussion
theres a load of questions and he has some mentoring company,2024-12-30T03:34:16.041000+00:00,SP,Discord,Work and Collaboration
sounds like you could avoid a lot of troubles if your friends dad just put these questions in a spreadsheet or already in categories,2024-12-30T03:33:51.893000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
into the set categories,2024-12-30T03:33:21.029000+00:00,SP,Discord,Technology and Education
and he wants me to go through those questions and categorise them,2024-12-30T03:33:15.573000+00:00,SP,Discord,General Discussion
and he has set categories,2024-12-30T03:33:04.293000+00:00,SP,Discord,Technology and Education
he just sends me few documents that have these questions,2024-12-30T03:32:58.982000+00:00,SP,Discord,Human Interaction
my friends dad has these questions in documents he made,2024-12-30T03:32:44.979000+00:00,SP,Discord,Human Interaction
try to give us a more concrete description of what you are trying to achieve so what documents who write them how do you obtain them why do you want to organize these questions etc,2024-12-30T03:30:31.083000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,General Discussion
i dont mind trying to answer,2024-12-30T03:29:54.261000+00:00,SP,Discord,General Discussion
what more info would u need to determine if its okay or not,2024-12-30T03:29:48.772000+00:00,SP,Discord,Critical Thinking
let me have a read,2024-12-30T03:29:34.313000+00:00,SP,Discord,Technical Discussions
i do but its way too vague for me to determine if this is against 443166941809737728,2024-12-30T03:28:57.352000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Problem Solving
what could be required,2024-12-30T03:28:54.907000+00:00,SP,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
like vague steps,2024-12-30T03:28:38.016000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
do you have any idea of the steps to achieving that,2024-12-30T03:28:33.557000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
i was wondering if i could automate such things to go through all my questions and answers instead of me manually doing it,2024-12-30T03:28:11.901000+00:00,SP,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
but i do have access to the categories,2024-12-30T03:27:44.875000+00:00,SP,Discord,AI and Tools
i dont have them to recall exactly right now,2024-12-30T03:27:38.221000+00:00,SP,Discord,Personal Experiences
the categories would be provided,2024-12-30T03:27:23.075000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
anything is possible but that will be complicated if you are new to coding especially the classification part for the categories if that is not provided to you,2024-12-30T03:26:10.274000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Modeling and Development
or no,2024-12-30T03:25:34.502000+00:00,SP,Discord,Work and Collaboration
so ive been doing it manually but would it even be possible to automate it,2024-12-30T03:25:19.807000+00:00,SP,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
thats the main objective i have questions and answers and i put those into each category so when students decide to do questions on that particular topic students can then select a certain category such as the difficultly being hard andor the question being essay based which then leads to those types of questions that i have put into those categories appearing,2024-12-30T03:24:39.576000+00:00,SP,Discord,Products and Economics
what problem would that solve for you to have them in categories,2024-12-30T03:22:54.212000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Work and Collaboration
and if that has any name so then i can read about it online more,2024-12-30T03:22:30.644000+00:00,SP,Discord,Big Ideas
but just curious if thats possible to even automate as some could say the categories are subjective and if it was possible what would be the vague steps to do that,2024-12-30T03:22:12.950000+00:00,SP,Discord,Modeling and Development
like ive been doing it manually myself,2024-12-30T03:21:31.540000+00:00,SP,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
can i automate a process of reading a document that contains questions and answers for ks3 maths  english science questions i need to categorise those questions inside that document to certain categories into things such as difficulty how long it could take like quick or long essay question or little written work required and some other stuff is that possible to like automate it,2024-12-30T03:21:09.624000+00:00,SP,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
i dont really know much about that,2024-12-30T03:18:08.099000+00:00,SP,Discord,General Discussion
then its reading a document,2024-12-30T03:18:04.846000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Big Ideas
is that still web scraping,2024-12-30T03:17:54.637000+00:00,SP,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving

add the current copyright notice to the files if you want the only important date in the notice is the first one anyway iirc,2024-12-26T13:47:58.285000+00:00,workmad3,Discord,Technical Discussions

hey guys im forking an apache 20 licensed github repository i want to ensure that i properly credit the original authors this project has been dead for several years not so long ago one dev has resurrected it but hes very busy and i think that this project fills a very big void in the community and that active development of this project would be of great benefit to the community the original project ha copyright commentsnotices on top of some of its files to properly differentiate between original work and my work i would like to ensure all source code files contain this those that are unmodified i only want to leave the original copyright notice those that are entirely new just my copyright notice and those that are mixed get both one thing is that the original copyright notice reads as follows copyright 20002017 jetbrains sro it is 20002017 but there were changes made since however no one updated the original copyright notices do you guys think its fine if i bump the copyright to include 2024 since today is the day that im officially starting this fork,2024-12-26T13:41:52.816000+00:00,Luky,Discord,Jobs and Hiring

my sort of wild thinking was that ive a spare phone i do not use if i was operating a hotspot off my main phone wirh my drone and the secondary phone the secondary phone can be the primary base for info to travel to from the drone,2024-12-25T00:40:34.094000+00:00,TritonFett,Discord,AI and Tools
what are you trying to do,2024-12-25T00:39:34.840000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,General Discussion
could it be done in a way that it only travels to that device also on the hotspot,2024-12-25T00:39:21.441000+00:00,TritonFett,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
depends where the application reside and what information needs to travel or not outside of the device,2024-12-25T00:38:52.097000+00:00,recursive_error,Discord,Modeling and Development
camera sensor network scanner all would need to feed back to an application which the info would surely travel over an internet or wifi connection ,2024-12-25T00:37:46.710000+00:00,TritonFett,Discord,Startups and Experience

an rpi would be good if you can install an rtos on it you need deterministic high speed control to run drone motors something linux cant do at least not until recently,2024-12-24T23:48:08.932000+00:00,DXPower,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
youd want a high power one to stream video,2024-12-24T23:47:26.595000+00:00,DXPower,Discord,Big Ideas

i hear youhaving separate idp configurations for each app can definitely get a bit tedious its great that theyre working fine overall but i wonder if theres room to consolidate and simplify things for example a centralized idp solution might help unify access management across tools like kubernetes and grafana reducing redundancy and making it easier to manage users and permissions have you explored anything like that or do you feel the individual setups are worth the tradeoff for flexibility,2024-12-23T16:28:40.969000+00:00,Rebeca Mituuti,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

 immediate and compelling need a project that you can do and see results with which requires c  i thought that picking c as my first programming language would be a good idea because it would give me more knowledge about how coding works and more fundamentals than stuff like python yes and no in the beginning you want to learn the fundimentals of programming this is stuff thats largely abstract how to move data around how to create and structure programs etc there is no major difference on a conceptual level here between using something like c vs c or python c will be more difficult to use because c will require you to focus on very specific details alongside learning the higher art of programming,2024-12-23T10:17:46.639000+00:00,Rusted Skull,Discord,Modeling and Development
yeah im using unity also wdym by immediate and compelling need i thought that picking c as my first programming language would be a good idea because it would give me more knowledge about how coding works and more fundamentals than stuff like python though idk if thats true though the fundamentals part,2024-12-23T10:14:54.101000+00:00,Moist and Ferocious,Discord,Modeling and Development

this is actually a very important point llms cannot produce anything novel they are basically just larger statistically driven auto completes over simplifying for sure but still if an llm produced it that means its training data contains many similar things already that is to say if the llm does a good job writing the code how inventive or novel can it really be,2024-12-22T15:30:42.759000+00:00,xxx>馃<xxx,Discord,Critical Thinking

 chatgpt sometimes writes plausiblesounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers fixing this issue is challenging as 1 during rl training theres currently no source of truth   chatgpt is an improvement to gpt that keeps better locality it provides 0 guarantees of accuracy or consistency and is not intended to generate information in an educational context you need to have the skill to identify when it is correct or incorrect ie know the answer to get utility out of it it helped me it can definitely generate helpful responses it can also just as well generate nonsensical responses with made up terms the issue is that telling the difference requires knowing the answer already making its utility as such a tool dubious at best unlike something like a simple web search or another human you do not get a way to gauge confidence or get alternative responses to compare and contrast against for example try to identify whats incorrect in the code explanation on the above blogpost it will keep getting better speculating on what distinct products in the future may offer is a different discussion unrelated to if this product is acceptable to be used to learn anything and implicitly acknowledges it is not currently in such a state additionally there are more caveats on its current behavior listed on the above blog post than the one quoted above gpt4 and future versions are unlikely to fix these problems without significant advancement in the field as these issues are largely inherent to the use of language learning models llms generally and not specifically openais products note that we do not currently allow generating answers to community questions using chatgpt or another automated tool as per rule 17 and ,2024-12-22T15:12:34.546000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Modeling and Development

its extremely easy for anyone to put anything they want as the from address in an email because of how email works the term email spoofing is usually referring to exactly that someone intentionally falsifying the sender information id bet good money that your email address happens to be on a list of 100s or 1000s of other addresses which some scammer put to a program that sends the template automatically and changes the from to be the same as the to theres a good chance the person who sent it didnt even see your email address with their own eyes they just downloaded the list and ran the program the reason why its so simple is because the way email works at the serverprotocol level really hasnt changed much from the way it worked back in the very early days of the internet when everyone using it either knew each other directly or through only a few degrees of separation security wasnt even a thing people thought about they were still trying to figure out if theyd be able to use it outside of the universities they worked at,2024-12-22T01:00:34.511000+00:00,xxx>馃<xxx,Discord,General Discussion

there is going to be a lot of technical stuff unfortunately but largely theres two or three big categories 1 programming itself which you can learn using the classic sources pick a language thats useful to you c for unity and godot for example and go ham 2 game related stuff theres probably books for this tbh basics of how to use an engine how games are structured software wise etc 3 specific game engine youre using so unity godot or whatever else youre using reference manuals and specific guides will help here larger engines will have guide books as well,2024-12-21T18:37:26.805000+00:00,Rusted Skull,Discord,Modeling and Development

help with implementing elasticsearch for multilingual english  arabic pdf search hi all im currently working on integrating elasticsearch into my python application this is my first attempt at using elasticsearch so id really appreciate some guidance what ive done so far 1 pdf processing hardcoded a folder from which my program fetches all pdf files iterates through each file extracting text page by page 2 data embedding embedded the text pagewise and stored both the text and its embedding in elasticsearch along with metadata like filename and page number 3 query handling when a query is entered its embedded and matched against the uploaded content to retrieve relevant data along with page numbers this setup is working well for english i also plan to enhance the search functionality to handle both textbased and embeddingbased queries in the future but for now im focusing on embeddings current challenge i want to extend this functionality to handle arabic pdfs allowing queries in either english or arabic to yield accurate results for example a user uploads an hr policy document in arabic they then query paternity leaves in english and the system should retrieve the relevant content or page number roadblock without any modifications i tried uploading an arabic document and querying in arabic but the results are poor less than 10 accuracy i added an arabic analyzer to the index mapping following elasticsearch documentation but the results are still inaccurate additional context my index is very basic since i only started this yesterday below are the links i referred to while setting this up elasticsearch language analyzers semantic search with nlp  elasticsearch geeksforgeeks ill also link the model im using for embeddings below would love to hear suggestions on improving my current index setup for arabic handling crosslingual search eg querying in english for arabic content,2024-12-18T18:35:25.799000+00:00,Breather,Discord,Modeling and Development

thank you ,2024-12-18T08:22:25.599000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Exploration and Sharing
it was an amazing lecture no cap,2024-12-18T08:22:16.477000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Work and Collaboration
wow that took so long lol,2024-12-18T08:22:04.909000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technical Discussions
yes,2024-12-18T08:21:55.497000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
139126745159827457,2024-12-18T08:21:51.864000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Work and Collaboration
832845499345666058,2024-12-18T08:21:47.912000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Work and Collaboration
oh shit are you guys still there,2024-12-18T08:21:20.911000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technical Discussions
tada,2024-12-18T08:21:02.258000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Work and Collaboration
is considered to be correct,2024-12-18T08:20:55.921000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technology and Education
because whichever blockchain has the most work put into it,2024-12-18T08:20:51.841000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
in order to uproot the correct blockchain youd have to redo all the work that all other computers did for that blockchain,2024-12-18T08:20:24.380000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
the reason why this is so special is,2024-12-18T08:20:00.665000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
the miner is then given a reward for finding that special number called the nonce along with a mining reward and whatever fees were given on the block,2024-12-18T08:19:44.642000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Personal Experiences
when you put that together with a block that is solid irrefutable proof saying i spent a bunch of computing power looking for this number,2024-12-18T08:19:18.271000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,AI and Tools
that means on average itd take a million hashes,2024-12-18T08:18:51.533000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
and you find a value thats small than a thousand,2024-12-18T08:18:41.320000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Company and Services
because if the range of a hash functions goes from 1 to a billion,2024-12-18T08:18:35.902000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Products and Economics
the way proof of work works is that each miner tries to search for a specific number that when put in a hash function together with a block yields a really small value,2024-12-18T08:17:24.057000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
theres a 1 in a 1000000 chance the hash value is below a million etc,2024-12-18T08:16:30.533000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,AI and Tools
out of any random input theres a 1 in a 1000 change that hash is below a billion,2024-12-18T08:16:14.677000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
lets just say the max value of a hash function is one trillion,2024-12-18T08:15:40.856000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Products and Economics
so the way proof of work works is by having a sort of lottery system with hashes,2024-12-18T08:15:14.778000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
you can hash any data,2024-12-18T08:14:45.419000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
you cant take v8h903282hfp443 and reverse it to 2,2024-12-18T08:14:33.617000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Critical Thinking
and the hash of 2 might be v8h903282hfp443,2024-12-18T08:14:06.877000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
so the hash of 1 might be f48u3p8 u98fvc0pa or something,2024-12-18T08:13:54.603000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
as a brief overview a hash function is a function where any input will create exactly one output from the input data but completely irreversible and random,2024-12-18T08:13:36.532000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
and whichever block has the most work put into it is considered the correct block,2024-12-18T08:12:27.046000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
what happens is that miners put work into each block which is by utilizing hashing in a clever way,2024-12-18T08:12:13.115000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
the absolutely fucking genius solution to this is called proof of work,2024-12-18T08:11:27.898000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Products and Economics
because you could have a bunch of transactions on one blockchain and a bunch on another and even though theyre all cryptographically valid no one knows how to choose which one is current,2024-12-18T08:11:09.812000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
now thats great and all but this alone isnt enough to create a consensus about which blockchain is the right one,2024-12-18T08:10:32.812000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
this is the first crucial part,2024-12-18T08:09:44.869000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
like signing a real life document except cryptographically secure,2024-12-18T08:09:27.930000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
and anyone can use person as public key to verify yes person a authorized this transaction,2024-12-18T08:09:04.594000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Problem Solving
because person a uses their private key to digitally sign each input thats being used in the transaction,2024-12-18T08:08:39.273000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,AI and Tools
you can ask why cant anyone just send any outputs they want to someone else,2024-12-18T08:07:59.134000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
which is being sent to person b,2024-12-18T08:07:24.620000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
and person a uses all those old outputs they own as inputs into this new output,2024-12-18T08:07:21.678000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technical Discussions
create a new output which will go on the next block sent to person b with an amount of 100,2024-12-18T08:06:41.355000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
and keep finding more until the amount adds up to 100,2024-12-18T08:06:09.779000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Problem Solving
you loop over all of the outputs in the utxoset that were sent to person a,2024-12-18T08:05:51.615000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Modeling and Development
if person a wants to send lets say an amount of 100 to person b,2024-12-18T08:05:19.147000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Human Interaction
name at least two packages that might be useful in a cybersecurity application and describe what they do you may need to research this a bit on the web,2024-12-18T08:04:51.473000+00:00,six,Discord,Modeling and Development
the set of all spendable outputs is called the utxoset or unspent transaction output set,2024-12-18T08:04:23.193000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technical Discussions
the way transactions work is that you take txoutputs from old blocks that are addressed to you and create new outputs which you then send to someone else,2024-12-18T08:03:51.676000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
your private key is used when you want to send crypto to others though,2024-12-18T08:02:44.190000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
everyone can see your public key and they can address money to you through it,2024-12-18T08:02:24.682000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
so basically in your wallet you have a public and a private key,2024-12-18T08:02:01.477000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
hashing,2024-12-18T08:01:30.404000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Work and Collaboration
it also has another important function which ill get to in a second,2024-12-18T08:01:17.510000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
like a cashapp username,2024-12-18T08:01:01.759000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
in cryptocurrency a public key essentially functions as an address,2024-12-18T08:00:46.126000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
each output has a spender  which is a public key txpredicate just contains a pk right now an amount millionths of a coin and a recipient public key,2024-12-18T07:59:40.016000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
so basically all transactions are composed of transaction outputs see struct txoutput here,2024-12-18T07:58:36.350000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Finance and Deals
well do the qa session after the lecture,2024-12-18T07:58:34.673000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
i just wanna explain this for vinit and preston for a sec,2024-12-18T07:57:56.688000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,AI and Tools
to create escrow you need multi signature or someway so that two party can ensure a transaction,2024-12-18T07:57:40.193000+00:00,Goatus,Discord,Finance and Deals
im a beginner,2024-12-18T07:57:09.755000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Critical Thinking
idek what that is,2024-12-18T07:57:06.596000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Work and Collaboration
oh nice are you going implement multi signature,2024-12-18T07:56:58.429000+00:00,Goatus,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
thats kinda besides the point tho,2024-12-18T07:56:32.903000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Technical Discussions
it uses ecdsa,2024-12-18T07:56:19.267000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Company and Services
rust crate,2024-12-18T07:56:13.259000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,AI and Tools
k256,2024-12-18T07:56:10.283000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Work and Collaboration
what library are you using for signature ,2024-12-18T07:56:05.226000+00:00,Goatus,Discord,Critical Thinking
trust is rooted in the consensus that whatever blockchain has the most work put into it is the correct ledger,2024-12-18T07:56:01.988000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,General Discussion
cryptocurrency is unique from other currencies because instead of being facilitated by a centralized entity,2024-12-18T07:55:25.886000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Startups and Experience
it looks like stuff is for blockchain,2024-12-18T07:55:19.551000+00:00,Goatus,Discord,General Discussion
so basically,2024-12-18T07:55:03.936000+00:00,Caffeinated Programmer,Discord,Products and Economics

as you already might have notices ive made games bcz i am into gaming ,2024-12-18T06:47:42.296000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
so let me build something thats will help me learn more and deal with challange,2024-12-18T06:47:13.095000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Company and Services

can you suggest me some good project that i can build using cpp,2024-12-18T06:45:35.198000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Critical Thinking
ha,2024-12-18T06:45:19.580000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Problem Solving
you take what you learn and build things,2024-12-18T06:45:14.496000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
exactly,2024-12-18T06:44:48.278000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Finance and Deals
he said computer science is not meant for just knowledge its more about application and implementing that knowledge,2024-12-18T06:42:33.411000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Modeling and Development
not when you click on a persons profile and click call from there,2024-12-18T06:42:26.359000+00:00,Rusted Skull,Discord,Finance and Deals
i heard this from my cs teacher,2024-12-18T06:41:57.180000+00:00,Vinit,Discord,Personal Experiences
also brb,2024-12-18T06:41:29.549000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
and thats where things get really interesting,2024-12-18T06:41:19.694000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
when you begin to apply what you learn everything is much much bigger,2024-12-18T06:41:12.262000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
computer science is more than just learning how to code and making small applications,2024-12-18T06:40:59.995000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Human Interaction
thats a big thing i learned,2024-12-18T06:40:48.142000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Modeling and Development
but its good to know that these things exist out there,2024-12-18T06:40:39.854000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
hard to know where to start,2024-12-18T06:40:30.915000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Company and Services

some exceptions of course but thats roughly how things work,2024-12-18T06:38:26.226000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,General Discussion
and our modern internet and any web application will basically exist as a cloud application,2024-12-18T06:38:12.207000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Startups and Experience
the cloud is a type of distributed system which is just a fancy way of saying multiple computers that all work together in one system,2024-12-18T06:37:47.924000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,AI and Tools
essentially speaking yes,2024-12-18T06:37:25.675000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Jobs and Hiring

there are so many ways of setting up a cloud computing infrastructure,2024-12-18T06:33:21.471000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Modeling and Development
in actuality the cloud is a massive network of tons of computers that will turn on and off not exactly but youll get the point depending on load for those servers theyll dynamically move the code of your website around so that your website is always available and optimally using resources like the internet and compute time,2024-12-18T06:32:59.920000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Modeling and Development
so i never have to manage the servers myself i just stick my website into this blob which runs everything for me and makes sure that my website never goes down,2024-12-18T06:31:51.628000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Critical Thinking
to a user the cloud is this big blob of computers and networks and all sorts of stuff that will run code for you whether its a website microservices all sorts of things i tell the blob hey can you run this website for me and it can do it without ever needing me to tell it what kind of computers to run on how many to run on how to always keep my website available etc,2024-12-18T06:31:31.118000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Critical Thinking

you want to make your code function well yes but you also want to make your code readable so other people can understand it in swe you are never ever just working in a vacuum youll always be working with others so you need to make sure they can read your code,2024-12-18T06:18:16.214000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Modeling and Development

biggest piece of advice i would give is adding some documentation i see you have some comments in your code but good practice is to add documentation to each function you make so people know exactly what your function does without having to read the source code adding more comments to confusing code also helps,2024-12-18T06:17:14.330000+00:00,JakeJack,Discord,Human Interaction

rust took me 4 weeks of hating the language until it suddenly klicked for me its not even the borrow checker  thats a nice gimmic but the type system especially the rust enums are just so expressive whats even better are the people using it theyre extremely nice and helpful in my experience and since most of them have at least decent programming experience the code quality is surprisingly high overall i just feel like its a great language to structure your data and really express yourself,2024-12-16T22:22:05.824000+00:00,acul009,Discord,AI and Tools

nah i dont mean that thing specifically but am just not so comfortable with how it works mostly not because of the language itself but cuz of its devs the way they structure code use packages like some solutions are based on packages that handles the database design they create the table and interact with it and you dont see explicitly whats happening thats just so weird to me,2024-12-16T20:28:30.376000+00:00,`${ViNoS}`,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

to be completely fair chasing after finding purpose is kinda selfdefeating in a way because any feelings of purpose come from within not from something external you cant exactly find it laying on the floor somewhere it kinda comes naturally over time as you get more experiences and understand yourself better over many years and yes you can speedrun it in a sense but that often experience many extreme experiences in your life both good and bad and it is often a rather demanding process if one does that,2024-12-13T09:41:35.162000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development

its like a central hub for memes people will upload images 1 image goes through embedding model image vector stored in a vector db 2 image is also fed to an multimodal llm that checks if theres any text on the image extracts it and runs that text through a text embedding model this vector is also stored in the vector db now when new memes are uploaded it will find the closest meme based on the imagetext if its too similar then it will not allow the meme upload and they can leave a comment under it instead so people can connect through esoteric memeage,2024-12-10T22:38:08.025000+00:00,dndrsn,Discord,Human Interaction

its not wrong to use it in general when you solving problems,2024-12-09T21:11:08.697000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Work and Collaboration
you can use ai as rubber duck sometimes,2024-12-09T21:10:57.678000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion
in complete honesty tho ai absolutelly can useful it can help and it can make you code betterquicker sometimes but you still have to understand what it is spilling out and why and if it the best solution for the situation best way to use ai as a programmerdeveloper is to think of it as a very good and sophisticated autocorrect that suggest things for you but it is not flawless and you should know what wordssentences it is suggesting you actually mean,2024-12-09T21:09:08.948000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

like the thing is fundamental issue with ai and llms is the following ais have no true understanding of what they do or create it is all very complex statistical data and probabilities some ai companies assumed that some form of understanding or consciousness will magically emerge from this stuff when they make it complex enough and feed it enough data but so far 0 luck in that regard,2024-12-09T21:02:13.686000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
from experience companies that are not worth your time and spits random projects uses bunch of stuff they taking shortucts they dont care about quality companies that are worth your time values your technical experience and your soft skills they make quality products they do code reviews they have processes standards they have mentors,2024-12-09T21:01:24.507000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Modeling and Development

so even colossus is just hype,2024-12-09T20:56:05.862000+00:00,DezOps,Discord,Technical Discussions
thing is  there are trillions of dollars already dumped in ai and the companies runningdeveloping it if you suddenly turn around to your investors and say sorry guys we were wrong this wont work you will lynched so badly that it will make french revolution look tame in comparison,2024-12-09T20:54:53.468000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Jobs and Hiring

somekind of side projectsapplications are being powered with ai that brings no real value at all its just a hype,2024-12-09T20:48:45.230000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
people uses those builders with wordpress and what do you do when you need to debug that lego stuff exactly you dont know you turn off turn on and expecting something to happen but you basically doing nothing you dont know what is exactly messing up maybe the wordpress itself is the problem after some kind of update kekw648990639182053386,2024-12-09T20:47:37.423000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion

so to say that  human language will become the dominant programming language in 12 months with all these ai tools  kekw648990639182053386,2024-12-09T20:45:24.544000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Big Ideas
why they happening,2024-12-09T20:43:34.126000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Work and Collaboration
what they are,2024-12-09T20:43:28.143000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Work and Collaboration
you cant because you dont know how to prevent race condition,2024-12-09T20:43:26.741000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion
imagine rewrite airplanes system with ai youre basically fucking up people lives without people in charge who understands how things work boeing crashed because of race condition you think you can spot race condition in generated code,2024-12-09T20:43:16.622000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
this is painfully true  you should always doublecheck the output of ai but that requires actual understading of the field from your end,2024-12-09T20:42:03.884000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development
because you dont understand anything,2024-12-09T20:41:44.775000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion
and the best part when everything is generated instead of written by devs  you wont debug that shit easily,2024-12-09T20:41:39.669000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Startups and Experience
ai is fine if you need some kind of short script like read from filewrite to file etc it will give you blueprints for other processes configurations but without understanding of them  you will be thinking that ai is always correct which is false,2024-12-09T20:41:13.373000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
theres a bunch of things to say but i can tell you one thing if you know your craft  you will always have a job specially in this field in your career you will see so much legacy stuff that you will understand that ai wont help here much to make a program cleanarchitectural correctoptimizedconcurrentscaled  you will go down rabbit hole with ai,2024-12-09T20:39:38.467000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion
and ais are kinda running out of data to train on atm because they more or less scoured the whole internet clean  believbe it or not,2024-12-09T20:27:21.616000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
so basically something like this  you need 100 input data units to get from 0 to 50 accuracy  you need another 100 input data units to get from 50 to 55  then you need another 100 to get from 55 to 56,2024-12-09T20:26:54.043000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development
because ai is based on llms and llms are based on math theories that make it progressively harder and harder to improve the accuracy as you get better and better results,2024-12-09T20:25:46.900000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Startups and Experience
is there any specific reason why you think that,2024-12-09T20:18:29.270000+00:00,DezOps,Discord,Modeling and Development
impossible to say for sure but my estimate is no,2024-12-09T20:16:59.443000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Critical Thinking

there are many people among programmers that have adhd as well  those people found ways to both utilize it to their benefit or to at least circumvent the negative effects of it i am sure you will eventually find such ways too if you keep trying to improve in programming,2024-12-04T21:31:19.861000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

so something stupid doesnt get passed somewhere else,2024-12-04T21:29:55.244000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
i also like interfaces  but mostly for stuff like typescript typechecking,2024-12-04T21:29:47.102000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion

classes is the main thing in oop,2024-12-04T21:25:36.968000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
i simply prefer composition to inheritance tbh i dont think there is anything wrong with classes on their own i just personally dislike them for very personal reasons  they absolutelly work fine if used by someone who likes using them,2024-12-04T21:25:10.981000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
without writing you wont understand them,2024-12-04T21:25:09.247000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Human Interaction
you have tools you use them when you think its needed thats it,2024-12-04T21:24:55.694000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Modeling and Development
better to simply go to the business logic right away and abstract only the absolute necessary when necessary only,2024-12-04T21:24:31.839000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Work and Collaboration

you focus so much on the abstraction that this becomes a loop hole you cant leave and when you see you business ideia was left behing so you could code your dream perfect project,2024-12-04T21:22:52.687000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Modeling and Development
i fucking hate classes kekw648990639182053386,2024-12-04T21:22:33.670000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Personal Experiences
yea i just tend to write php without classes,2024-12-04T21:22:20.633000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
so you can pass child class of the parent somewhere and it should work the same program should not crash,2024-12-04T21:22:06.496000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
again too much abstraction ealy on this level of abstraction is for functional projects that need it,2024-12-04T21:22:04.802000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Modeling and Development
basically classes does not depend on concrete classes but on interface,2024-12-04T21:21:31.783000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Jobs and Hiring

i always trying to code to interface not to implementation,2024-12-04T21:20:29.005000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Human Interaction
too much abstraction early on while i stilll dont know what will i exactly need and how,2024-12-04T21:19:57.455000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,General Discussion
much harder to write tests for coupled code,2024-12-04T21:19:44.216000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Human Interaction

frameworks out of the box gives you structure from skeleton,2024-12-04T21:18:42.214000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Technical Discussions
you should write from the begining with right structure,2024-12-04T21:18:27.233000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Personal Experiences
easier to switch between database types if needed,2024-12-04T21:18:11.213000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Products and Economics
but i think this is better as refactor implementation rather then implementing it during the beginning of a project,2024-12-04T21:18:10.279000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Modeling and Development

im also thinking how is this bad,2024-12-04T21:16:38.292000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,General Discussion
yeah,2024-12-04T21:16:32.780000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Finance and Deals
what this is just logical code splitting so you know where stuff is if you need to adjust it later ondebug it,2024-12-04T21:16:28.048000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
like if you are starting a backend project imo  you should only implement repository pattern if all the logic is already done and working,2024-12-04T21:15:58.189000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Modeling and Development
the contract you have to create makes de code rigid makes you rely to much on conditionals to implement the business logic,2024-12-04T21:14:03.976000+00:00,ALDUIIN,Discord,Work and Collaboration

depends on the queries how often do you need those columns and logic how these columns will change to hold it in separate database will increase scalability technically but probably so little that you wont notice for a few columns in this context probably separate database is overengineering it would be better to store in the separate table but in the same database and it will also scale like that same table id email password age separate for roles separate for profession separate for subscription status there probably you will want to do some grouping filtering logic etc scanning will be faster for a table with less columns its called vertical partitioning depending on queries count complexity and how much data there is  it could be split even more,2024-12-04T20:50:29.565000+00:00,zlatan,Discord,Modeling and Development

in all honesty  ui libs can be great but they tend to be better either for very specific projects or some earlybeta development or prototyping because they often end up being very limiting in what they can do and something when you need to go beyond that they start getting really in the way,2024-12-02T20:56:54.977000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development

question regarding git rebase if u git rebase the feature branch on to the main branch then the oldest commit in ur feature branch would be on top of the newest commit in the main branch but now the oldest commits message of ur branch would not reflect the change between it and the previous mains newest commit am i supposed to change the commit message with interactive reabase im asking whats best practice here advice appreciated,2024-11-26T08:11:58.891000+00:00,Charizard,Discord,Critical Thinking

yep the entire company i work at uses react and react only that said id say the second most popular by usage is angular rather than vue no research just guesswork,2024-11-16T00:42:02.602000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Finance and Deals

which is kinda insane when you think of it that react has 60 of everything,2024-11-15T13:32:52.520000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
worldwide it is react all the way about 60 of serious fe jobs are react and the 40 remaining are a mixture of vue angular svelte any other framework and stuff like vanilla js htmx templating jquery etc etc basically anything else,2024-11-15T13:32:39.871000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

true have you seen any svelte jobs other than maybe startups,2024-11-15T13:26:36.737000+00:00,Def,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
oh my might actually learn this,2024-11-15T13:26:07.270000+00:00,Def,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
unless we are talking stuff like jquery but that is an entirely different market focus to begin with,2024-11-15T13:25:34.439000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
they already are  realistically we have react as the big one and then vue angular and svelte as the smaller ones rest is just gimmicks and hobby projects tbh no actual company wants to use almost anything else,2024-11-15T13:25:17.625000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development

yep when you think about it theyre becoming really similar,2024-11-15T13:17:18.339000+00:00,Def,Discord,General Discussion
and i actually heard some people say that they feel like as if all the js frameworks seem to be kinda converging into making a lot of fundamental things work in the same way so maybe the frontend js frameworks are finally maturing in a way that people found optimal ways how to handle most issues and we will slowly end up seeing mostly just different iterrations of the same thing,2024-11-15T13:16:40.130000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Modeling and Development

so umm am working with face recognition and i want an accurate and fast respond processing i used for detection opencv and tried insightface too and for recognition deepface but still notice some lag  i used the gpu processing for the insightface for faster results i do have an rtx 3050 but still lagging so i did my research and i guess tensorrt for recognition works well with gpu but i dont have time to dive deep in tensorrt i have a month for the project and still have to link my backend which is the detection and recignition to the front end so any one knows a good library to avoid the lag because it is real time processing,2024-11-12T21:41:05.097000+00:00,Pyon,Discord,General Discussion

for projects as big as svelte i wouldnt say they dont deal with complex typing,2024-09-26T22:38:14.542000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Modeling and Development

you can argue if svelte or turbo are badly made projects but theres enough a reason for jsdoc to be used in very specific situations,2024-09-26T22:25:05.516000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Modeling and Development
that sounds like a badly madeoptimized project then no gonna lie lol,2024-09-26T22:19:40.465000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
well it gets transpiled and then bundled,2024-09-26T22:19:17.068000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,General Discussion
as opposed to transpilation,2024-09-26T22:10:59.526000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Work and Collaboration
and the code gets bundled into a dist folder not transpiled that is an unavoidable step,2024-09-26T22:10:49.840000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Modeling and Development
i wouldnt say that projects with thousands of files can be hampered by the transpilation time a lot in fact ive seen a library or bundler at some point move go jsdoc exactly because of this theres actually a fireship video on this,2024-09-26T22:10:30.314000+00:00,MWR,Discord,General Discussion
 its better than ts if your build system needs to be performant and the time you save from ts transpilation is worth it considering all code gets transpiled to a builddist file this play no role in anything unless you are litetally talking the development time it takes to transpile to see the changes which is minimal unless you are developing on a literal potato,2024-09-26T22:09:00.743000+00:00,Elvanos,Discord,Human Interaction
jsdoc is cumbersome because it pollutes your code with gigantic lines of comments its better than ts if your build system needs to be performant and the time you save from ts transpilation is worth it,2024-09-26T21:05:41.506000+00:00,MWR,Discord,Human Interaction

hello guys i am looking for some advice or maybe perspectives i am making a website using django the targeted audience is going to be mobile users basically the main flow looks like the user visits the website look at a bunch of info and clicks on the get started button and then go through a multi step form ive used django wizard formtools for this theres 5 steps in total and in the last step they will have to upload some documentation then gets redirected to the payment page and ive used stripe for this my issue is that my users could be authenticated or anonymous users ive used all auth for the authentication however if the users proceeds to pay as an anonymous user i am afraid that would result in a lot of clutter in my database since they are not registered users for this i thought i either have to force them to create an account right after the get started process but i feel its a bit less user friendly also if theyre registered this would help decrease the number of steps at the beginning of the process and i can store information about their payment or any information i need to store and if i allow them to carry on till the end without having an account im wondering to where redirect them after completing the process so the can see their payment invoice maybe other things i am a little bit confused,2024-09-01T17:54:35.144000+00:00,kanpachi,Discord,Modeling and Development

im not sure what you are saying is switched up because i agree with what you said if the electromotive force is some voltage v the current that is pushed through is i  v  rload  r proportional to v and the resistances hold the current back the voltage across the internal resistor is then vint  i r  v  r  rload  r in opposition to v and so the total voltage of the battery is vab  v  rload  rload  r about the current measurements i am asking about the possibility that the leads of your ammeter are the wrong way around which would give a negative reading not whether you attached the battery in the opposite direction of the light emitting diode also wdym it was not current a but voltage v,2024-12-18T02:55:52.637000+00:00,Duck,Discord,Technology and Education
isnt it switched up voltage should push the current in ratio of the potencial between 2 end and resistance holds the current back nope i dont even need to measure cause if i put it as ll it wont light up but if i put it as ll and it was not current a but voltage v led as a resistor is fin imo in this use case i whish sheldon were real so i could ask him,2024-12-17T20:44:36.016000+00:00,Not your oppa,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
after searching online its probably internal resistance shenanigans if they are old batteries they might have a reasonably high internal resistance and so when you are measuring the batteries voltage you are also measuring the internal resistance think of it like this a battery with internal resistance can be modelled as an ideal battery and a resistor in series when you apply the load to the battery you are increasing the current across the battery which was basically zero when measured with the multimeter this increases the voltage that the internal resistor is supplying in resistance to the batterys voltage and about the 010 and 040 current measurements idk is it possible that you were measuring current in the opposite direction also if you attach resistors of different known resistances as the load you could probably measure the modelled internal resistance also disclaimer i dont know electronics that well seen by how ive modelled the led below as a resistor bcs idk,2024-12-17T12:31:18.131000+00:00,Duck,Discord,General Discussion
anyone,2024-12-17T12:11:31.478000+00:00,Not your oppa,Discord,Company and Services
so i have 2 old 12v batteries when i measure them i get about 4v each but if i connect a led as a load it drops down to 2v each math checks out and everyting is fine then when i connect them in series i get 8v with no load but when i put the led there i get 2v again also i get like from 010 to 040 when i measure dc on old battery my teacher said that my dmm is bad cause otherwise i would have broken the laws physics but i have 2 dmm and both say the same so how do the voltage drops to 2 when the actual voltage should be 2 so 22 should be 4 can you have a negatively charged battery,2024-12-15T22:15:44.976000+00:00,Not your oppa,Discord,Products and Economics

you could try and use induction heating that would also be very plausable if you can make a proper circuit for it,2024-04-19T19:23:45.564000+00:00,Seven's Embrace,Discord,Modeling and Development
a laser strong enough to be useful for a klin will vaporize the material before it heats it a laser array would work but at horrific efficiency and with very strong risks of blindness as anything that strong is well in the class 4 range requiring special protection on top of standard protection for strong lasers,2024-04-19T19:23:19.369000+00:00,Seven's Embrace,Discord,Technology and Education

or at least keep the filament in a stable state while i heat things in a co2 environment,2024-04-19T01:29:16.008000+00:00,elezzar,Discord,AI and Tools
im not a chemist but does that mean i could potentially get a coating of pure carbon on the filament not sure if this would act as a protective coating per se,2024-04-19T01:27:56.164000+00:00,elezzar,Discord,General Discussion
and then after it heats past the decomposition point of tungsten carbide itll turn into carbon and tungsten again,2024-04-19T01:27:24.616000+00:00,elezzar,Discord,Human Interaction
in a pure co2 atmosphere enviroment wouldnt the tunsten just turn into tungsten carbide,2024-04-19T01:25:48.216000+00:00,elezzar,Discord,Company and Services

it depends on how thick the wire is and how much force you are willing to apply you can wrap it around something and then power it briefly though i suggest that you use nichrome wire for open air applications,2024-04-18T17:33:54.176000+00:00,Seven's Embrace,Discord,Critical Thinking

its because governments are slow to take real action and most fossil plants also exist on the outskirts unless they are rather old,2022-07-14T23:14:33.101000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Startups and Experience

there is still a chance and thats all it takes there is a huge reason nuclear power is not currently being pursued in most developed countries as a main alternative,2022-07-14T23:13:33.929000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,13,
the harm fossil fuel plants do is higher in my opinion,2022-07-14T23:13:20.282000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Problem Solving
most if it is fear mongering in my opinion the chance is really low with modern technology and modern reactor designs especially thorioum ones,2022-07-14T23:12:57.266000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,General Discussion
most people dont know there are many more useful technologies that make fission safer and waste easier to storereuse,2022-07-14T23:12:12.963000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving

isp or specific impulse shows how much of impulse ns or kgfs a rocket engine produces while burning one unit of mass of the propellant thus if you multiply the isp by the mass of propellant reaction mass used by the rocket engine you will get the thrust ispfdmdt where f is the force of thrust and dmdt is consumption of reaction mass per second isp can be measured in seconds if consumption of the reaction mass is measured in kilograms and the thrust is measured in kilogramsforce kgf if the force is in newtons n then the unit of isp is nskg if the consumption of the reaction mass is measured in pounds per second and the force is measured in poundsforce the unit of isp is still a second traditionally isp is reported in seconds and the exhaust velocity of the reaction mass of a rocket is 980665isp meters per second if isp is given in nskg then the exhaust velocity in ms is equal to isp isp of chemical rocket engines is typically between 260 and 360 seconds depending on the propellant components and design of the rocket engine some propellant components may provide isp up to 450 seconds but such components are rarely used for example if a rocket engine burns 200 kg of propellant each second and its isp is 300 seconds it produces the thrust of 600 kgf kilogramsforce or 5884 n,2022-04-26T17:05:02.358000+00:00,V.B.,Discord,Products and Economics

i wrote this is this right or is this complete nonesense the moxie instrument is a demonstration mission designed to demonstrate that we can produce pure oxygen on the surface of mars if successful nasa may choose to send a dedicated mission to produce oxygen for human use in the future so how do we make oxygen on the surface of mars basically what we do is take mars atmosphere and pass it through a unit called a solid oxide electrolytic unit which is essentially an upside down fuel cell so this is a solid oxide electrolytic unit what happens is the atmosphere of mars goes into that line goes into the soxe unit to test this technology you will need an atmosphere on mars we call it mixed gas on mars and we use it for most of our tests so the way we tested it we designed a system of instrumentation covers all equipment conditions lower pressure higher pressure clogged filter oxygen purity all of that,2021-11-30T09:58:22.338000+00:00,David,Discord,Products and Economics

to be honest youll end up getting clinical experience etc anyway if you go to med school but your training in the basic sciences is specific and within certain limits i think a lot of people especially people in healthcare either lack or can benefit from more basic science training yes even mds misinformation pseudoscience and medical errors arent new but the pandemic has shown me how many people fall for all that stuff an unfortunately thats even true for healthcare personnel who push antivax and other science contrarian positions,2023-12-23T07:43:17.144000+00:00,V.,Discord,Energy and Problem Solving
but i guess it doesnt matter as much since apparently people do random philosophy or politics degrees and then go to med school at least youre getting some health or bio fundamentals with either of your choices nursing will make you more familiar with health clinical practicepatientshealthcare biochem and anything related degrees will make you more familiar with the basic science of how the body works etc,2023-12-23T07:39:14.935000+00:00,V.,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

hello,2023-07-03T14:44:23.984000+00:00,Rogue,Discord,Exploration and Sharing
the thesis is a detailed account of research or a scientific treatise of a subject which requires a lot of in depth analysis,2023-06-28T13:40:44.552000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,6,
a masters thesis is extremely different to a highschool essay,2023-06-28T13:40:22.887000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,14,
well the problem is untilnow in high school i felt the word limit always felt like a minimum i truly never felt that i was constrained to less words and had to makeit more wordy to get my point across i hope its different in college where they ask us to be more concise,2023-06-28T13:34:35.370000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
but there are cases where a minimum is indeed asked id be surprised if this were true for a masters thesis,2023-06-27T19:57:00.370000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,1,

ah length maximum vs length minimum,2023-06-27T19:53:22.026000+00:00,Kaito,Discord,Personal Experiences
typically during a thesis its the case where theres too much information which one later needs to condense thus prioritising conciseness,2023-06-27T19:44:30.564000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,18,
its the opposite a length requirement typically forces you to be more concise,2023-06-27T19:43:34.756000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,12,
length requirements only encourage using imprecise language getting your point across as concisely as possible is an art,2023-06-27T19:19:04.761000+00:00,Kaito,Discord,Personal Experiences
then its on them not you,2023-06-27T18:49:45.348000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,0,
is it a problem if a masters thesis is only 1112 thousand words when the university has not provided any specific number of words or pages required,2023-06-27T18:32:03.755000+00:00,SilSil,Discord,Products and Economics

ill preface this by saying that the institution doesnt matter as much as the program does i personally give more emphasis on the course material than the prestige of the institution for example i scored high enough to get accepted at the history and philosophy of science department of the most prestigious institution in my country but i prioritised a different program at a different university because i had looked at the course content and i liked it more as it was more compatible with the career im pursuing within the same program whats more important is the student rather than the institution this is key and people dont emphasize it enough anyway it also depends on your country but my favourite institutions for medicine assuming thats what you mean by medical schooling are jhu harvard icl ucl gkt at kcl osu upenn stanford cambridge ut anderson medical center duke washu oxford ucla yale,2023-02-27T23:28:25.362000+00:00,V.,Discord,General Discussion

depends on where you live,2022-12-12T20:52:39.138000+00:00,TC159,Discord,Time and Productivity

alright,2022-12-12T18:20:11.131000+00:00,V.,Discord,Big Ideas
i know hes right i just didnt want to say something and start an argument for no reason,2022-12-12T18:19:33.234000+00:00,Dapper Noodle,Discord,Modeling and Development
ok good,2022-12-12T18:15:38.291000+00:00,V.,Discord,General Discussion
as i said later on,2022-12-12T18:13:45.545000+00:00,Dapper Noodle,Discord,Time and Productivity
im due to write a literature review and its so cumbersome ,2022-12-12T18:05:55.410000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,19,
but thats still not research lol its not a metaanalysis its an assignment,2022-12-12T18:05:19.826000+00:00,V.,Discord,Work and Collaboration
just want to say that it doesnt detract from it whatsoever thats not the intention here just that we have to understand each other and the implications of what a word means,2022-12-12T18:05:15.857000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,14,
dapper hes right its not a research paper its not going to get published the term research paper refers to a very specific form of manuscript in science and as a science major you should know that your manuscript literally cant be called a research paper unless its been published by a journal not any term paper or assignment is a research paper,2022-12-12T18:04:15.529000+00:00,V.,Discord,Critical Thinking
yeah its not a research paper its like a term paper,2022-12-12T18:01:43.040000+00:00,V.,Discord,Finance and Deals
that said well done  is it something you can share on here,2022-12-12T17:45:15.973000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,14,
we were also discussing why research papers are so terse to produce and he mentioned its just the details and standards a lot of time goes to satisfying reviewers thats why you typically try to pick your own reviewers if you know them and polish the paper up to standards of the field,2022-12-12T17:44:01.056000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,14,
i had this discussion with my supervisor on writing a paper in a short time span and his point was quite interesting he said you want to be very careful with what you publish and how you publish it the moment you do you become an authority,2022-12-12T17:41:44.903000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,8,
just that a research paper entails a very hefty preparation  hell even a literature review is quite dense and heavy but perhaps less rigorous,2022-12-12T17:39:51.865000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,10,
still am even if its not,2022-12-12T17:39:18.548000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,3,
so i was naturally quite excited to probe you on it,2022-12-12T17:38:59.042000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,12,
because a research paper has an incredibly specific connotation in science,2022-12-12T17:38:45.393000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,2,
just trying to understand,2022-12-12T17:38:29.862000+00:00,ICEY l 鈱?N=N-鈱?Discord,1,
its just the standard grading type,2022-12-12T15:30:29.205000+00:00,Cameron,Discord,Technology and Education
which sounds less impressive,2022-12-12T14:47:45.593000+00:00,TC159,Discord,Technology and Education
but because i dont i have an average of 18,2022-12-12T14:47:34.157000+00:00,TC159,Discord,General Discussion
if i had that style of grading id have an a average,2022-12-12T14:47:21.198000+00:00,TC159,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration
i like that way of grading here we grade from 120,2022-12-12T14:47:02.271000+00:00,TC159,Discord,Motivation and Inspiration

there is a path i could take that allows me to focus on renewables and the such,2022-12-12T11:13:36.263000+00:00,Unknown,Discord,Jobs and Hiring
that doesnt seem like you would focus on a specific source of energy like renewables or other stuff do you plan on working with a specific source or just infrastructure,2022-12-12T11:12:44.622000+00:00,Cameron,Discord,Modeling and Development

do you guys understand the toulmin model of argumentation very well,2022-12-12T10:23:33.326000+00:00,Cameron,Discord,Products and Economics
that does seem potentially helpful i need to check whether something like that is possible to use as a source or if it has to be an actual paper my argument was going to be more pro gen ed but my rebuttal was going to be about how the programs themselves and students dont really go about general education the right way and stuff,2022-12-12T10:21:30.463000+00:00,Cameron,Discord,General Discussion

in my experience cyanide has a point that a lot of undergrads dont know how to search or read papers and most dont even try to learn youre one of thr few who bot only genuinely tries to learn stuff but even when you were an undergrad a couple of years back let alone now you actually knew what you were doing you had your shit together you could read a paper and you knew how to look for one no one in my year even knows what a doi is how to find it and what its meant for except maybe one person who has an idea but thats only because i taught her it we were doing a group project in my experience a lot of undergrads are next to clueless when it comes to looking for papers and interpreting them im not even joking ive seen other students bibliographyreferences in their projects and its random popsci sites blogs or media articles from sites like sportslifestylenewscom,2022-12-01T10:25:18.297000+00:00,V.,Discord,Modeling and Development

noone directly in fact there is not that much use for people living right now besides maybe talking with satellites far away but it could teach us more about our universe which in many years might become useful but we dont know that yet it could accelerate us understanding the laws of physics and getting a more correct model of the universe which indirectly leads to new technologies and those in turn can help humanity but as you can see thats quite far already that is also why it it criticized a lot many people find that we should first focus on getting our stuff together here on earth that this funding that goes to things like radio astronomy or other research that doesnt directly help solve the problems we have now would better go to more urgent problems like climate change getting world peace or increasing production capacity so we can solve famine or poverty in general and seen the distance of the observations done in radio astronomy we can wait another 1000 years before we resume research likely much more efficient as well have better materials and better technology overall,2022-09-19T08:22:51.262000+00:00,screbuts,Discord,Modeling and Development

probably good to try to plan and stick to a routine but with you being in charge of yourself you can do what you like also depends on if you are in halls with catering and set meal times selfcatering accommodation where you buy your own food in and cook or relying on the institution cafesrestaurants  these will each probably have their own set opening times getting a routine for mealtimes will also help you organise your study time you can be as flexible or rigid with your plan as you see fit,2022-08-12T09:39:50.334000+00:00,Carpal Humbug,Discord,General Discussion

so my suggestioninform your colleague that you will reach out to your professor with the excuse that amount of work you have to do alone if he doesnt cooperate is too big,2022-05-24T15:53:13.584000+00:00,GeoLek,Discord,General Discussion
definitely agree with that i used to think that reporting these kind of things to the professor would be bad for your colleagues but most of the time papers and homework is given based on the number of the people they will work on it if you work alone you will both have much more work to do and probably get a worse grade because of the fact that the work is given to more people,2022-05-24T15:52:07.626000+00:00,GeoLek,Discord,General Discussion

if i had to chose between  apple gains competitive advantage  meta rapes my privacy ill chose the former obviously there is another option of opening up the apis in a careful thought out way but people should realize that doing this carefully takes time,30-12-2024 18:30,Peter55667,Reddit,Finance and Deals
weve seen repeatedly how meta will abuse anything they can get their hands on both for their users but also those who dont use their services remember when facebook was paying teens to use a free vpn so scrape even more info meta is in the business of scraping your info to make a dollar and everything they do is motivated by that if they have access to your message history my messages to you are now exposed and from their history we know theyll scrape anything and everything if meta wants the ability in ios to make whatsapp messenger or instagram the default messaging app sure im all for it if they want to make competing apps for everything on my phone with the option to make it the default ill support it meta wanting access to the messages stored in the messages app absolutely not supporting that same goes with access to all notifications from all apps on my phone info on connected bluetooth devices and wifi networks and many of the other things they want edit heres apples official report on what meta is asking for link,30-12-2024 18:30,Peter55667,Reddit,Critical Thinking

by shubhangi goel business insider lyft has accused the city of san francisco in a lawsuit of overcharging it 100 million in taxes over five years arguing that the city used a calculation that doesnt reflect the ridehailing firms business model the lawsuit filed at the california superior court in san francisco says the city calculated lyfts 2019 to 2023 taxes based on the total amount passengers paid for rides but lyft says it makes money from what drivers pay to lyft not what passengers pay to the drivers drivers make at least 70 of what the passenger pays according to lyfts website lyft considers drivers as customers who use its service and not employees the company said in the state court complaint  last year gigeconomy companies scored a big win after a california appeals court upheld a law that classified gig workers as independent contractors not employees but that argument hasnt always worked out for these companies in other markets in 2021 the uk ruled that uber drivers must be treated as company employees and not independent workers after a fiveyear legal battle,28-12-2024 2:22,marketrent,Reddit,Work and Collaboration

for those that didnt read or dont understand lyfts argument is quite straightforward and consistent with their financial reporting sec and state  federal taxes the city is financially incentivized to disagree passenger pays 100 in fare  60 goes to driver  40 goes to lyft the 60 going to the driver will be counted as 1099 contractor income and is subject to income tax when the driver files their state and federal return the 40 going to lyft is recorded as revenue and goes towards funding operating expenses san francisco taxes are applied at the full fare of 100 and lyft is arguing that it should be applied at the 40 that lyft receives otherwise its essentially a gross revenue tax on both the driver a worker earning income and lyft for any other company that employs people this would be applied at the 100 level because the driver is part of lyft and therefore the 100 goes entirely to lyfts revenue the analogy is that you buy furniture from ikea 1000 pay a sales tax of 10 but the assembly of furniture through your third party wont be billed with a 10 sales tax as well would this result in lower fares probably not lyft will just line their pockets more with the extra money consumers have become used to paying,28-12-2024 2:22,marketrent,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
maybe lyft is right in this case but lyft and uber popularized using independent contractors and its taking over many industries many companies now treat contractors as full time employees in virtually every way that benefits the company but not the workers contractors should be used for truly temporary needs need extra hands for two weeks at christmas sure need someone to digitize old paper records for 4 months sure need a drafter to handle asbuilt drawings for the foreseeable future this person should be an employee need cleaning staff for your office this person should be an employee i am fine with what is essentially a trial period but it needs to have a time limit that is less than half of the year there needs to be a very long cool down period to prevent ending then restarting the contract every short contract period,28-12-2024 2:22,marketrent,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

bench ran at a loss the entire 5 years i worked there there was a continuous exploration of ideas to figure out how to make it profitable multiple failed partnerships that didnt bring in customers a short fling with banking etc expensive product design and i would argue inflated senior leadership team size and wage packet at its core it could not get past the customer volume per employee needed to become profitable in the last 3 years this shifted to an increase in customers per bookkeeper combined with handing more duties to machine learning and a restructuring of operations away from personalised bookkeeper to volume this of course led to a reduction in quality delay in service delivery and ultimately increase in churn which fed the same cycle again it couldnt stay in that high quality service bracket with its old structure because it would have gone out of business it couldnt scale a solution to work either sadly its a shame because the average employee gave so much during my time there thankfully i got out earlier than this but it is sad to see so many of my former colleagues impacted,28-12-2024 0:45,marketrent,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

my concern with ubi schemes is that who gets to determine what level the basic is when coupled with providing safe housing healthcare and education then it serves a good purpose and has shown to be an overall benefit if ubi becomes an allowance from which people need to spend to provide the basics i am worried that without a serious discussion about what level of incomeallowance people need to not only survive but to thrive as individuals the fact that basic income is being promoted by the super wealthy should be of concern regardless of their intentions,27-12-2024 12:53,AdSpecialist6598,Reddit,Problem Solving

by ft lifer sarah oconnor  this month the oecd released the results of a vast exercise inperson assessments of the literacy numeracy and problemsolving skills of 160000 adults aged 1665 in 31 different countries and economies  thirty per cent of americans read at a level that you would expect from a 10yearold child andreas schleicher director for education and skills at the oecd told me  referring to the proportion of people in the us who scored level 1 or below in literacy it is actually hard to imagine  that every third person you meet on the street has difficulties reading even simple things in some countries the deterioration is partly explained by an ageing population and rising levels of immigration but schleicher says these factors alone do not fully account for the trend his own hypothesis would come as no surprise to the critic postman that technology has changed the way many of us consume information away from longer more complex pieces of writing such as books and newspaper articles to short social media posts and video clips at the same time social media has made it more likely that you read stuff that confirms your views rather than engages with diverse perspectives and thats what you need to get to the top levels on the oecd literacy assessment where you need to distinguish fact from opinion navigate ambiguity manage complexity schleicher explained  schleicher worries that people with poor literacy skills will become naive consumers of prefabricated content in other words without solid skills of your own it is only a few short steps from being supported by the machine to finding yourself dependent on it or subject to it,26-12-2024 23:52,marketrent,Reddit,Modeling and Development

looking at benchmark data the loongson 3a6000 which was the last chinese flagship it was somewhere between an i7 3770 and a i7 4770 which will released april 2012 and june 2013 granted that longson was released late 2023 but even if they achieved two generations of uplift with their next processor in 2025 that would still put them around a 2015 intel equivalent so the 1015 years is about right some things to take into account though is how intel stalled on their own progress with 14nm having far more generations than normal and the 11th and 14th generation basically being pointless and in a few areas stepped backwards thats not to say that means china can easily leap ahead it shows how even one of the most experienced chip designers in the world has issues with progress and yield the oxidization issue on intel 12th and 13th generation cpus also shows how defects along the way of manufacturing can make what seems like a good chip turn out to be a problem when you thought you had a success transistors have become so small that the gates are only in atom wide and its hard to shrink something below an atom that could mean its a difficulty for china to catch up that could also mean its a difficulty for current cpu manufacturers to continue the progress theyve been making at the same pace allowing china to catch up but no matter what even if all current chip design progress stalled and china managed to have two times faster improvements on chip design than historically intel and amd have had its still easily five years until they would be on par unless they seize taiwan and take tsmc so you know no knowing when theyll suddenly catch up,25-12-2024 21:44,ControlCAD,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

by maria deutscher apple inc has asked to participate in an upcoming antitrust trial that will focus on google llcs practices in the search market reuters reported the request today citing a court document filed on monday in august a federal judge found that google maintains an illegal monopoly across the search engine and search text advertising segments one focus of the ruling was a set of agreements that the company maintains with handset makers under those contracts the handset makers must set google as the default search engine on their devices apple is one of the companies with which the alphabet inc unit has inked such an agreement according to bloomberg google pays the iphone maker billions of dollars per year as part of the contract those payments are part of the reason apple plans to join the upcoming antitrust trial the trial will determine how google should change its business practices to comply with antitrust rules the justice department which is leading the litigation will ask the court to scrap googles default search engine agreement with apple this means that the iphone maker would no longer receive payments from google which is what it could potentially avoid by joining the litigation the justice department argues that the agreement should be scrapped because it disincentives apple from building a competing search engine in mondays court filing the iphone maker stated that it wouldnt seek to compete with google even if the contract were to end ,25-12-2024 18:01,marketrent,Reddit,Finance and Deals

by rasmus kleis nielsen  dotdash meredith is on course to generate over 15 billion in revenues in 2024 more than a third of it from print so the openai deal is equal to about 1 of the publishers total revenue if that strikes you as low remember that openais deal with axel springer said to be worth about 10 million per year is worth well under 1 of springers media revenues welcome surely lucrative in a sense game changer hardly continued decline in print revenues alone will have a far bigger impact on both dotdash meredith and axel springers revenues in 2025 than their deals with openai and this is for two of the so far very few publishers who have actually gotten deals  given that various lawsuits and lobbying efforts will likely drag on the main factor that could lead to a different outcome would be a dramatic political intervention the question then is whether publishers can expect this  or should even seek it  from the very politicians they also say they hold to account would say the us news media want to rely on favors from the incoming trump administration so my prediction for 2025 is that most publishers will not get any meaningful revenue from licensing content to technology companies and that those who do are likely to be large publishers who get at most a few percent of incremental revenue for most publishers while perhaps a disappointing prospect i hope this will also be liberating if they dont stand around waiting for the godot of elusive ai licensing deals they can focus on what matters  creating value not for tech companies training models but for members of the public who want to make sense of the world beyond personal experience ,25-12-2024 15:36,marketrent,Reddit,Modeling and Development

najmeh bozorgmehr in tehran 56 minutes ago the reformist government of masoud pezeshkian has lifted irans ban on whatsapp and google play in a first step towards easing internet restrictions in the nation of 85mn people a highlevel meeting chaired by president pezeshkian on tuesday overcame resistance from hardline factions within the islamic regime iranian media reported as the government seeks to reduce pressures on civil society today we took the first step towards lifting internet restrictions by demonstrating unity sattar hashemi irans minister of telecommunications wrote on x this path will continue this move comes after pezeshkian refused to enforce a hijab law recently ratified by the hardline parliament that would have imposed tougher punishments on women choosing not to observe a strict dress codehis government has also quietly reinstated dozens of university students and professors who had previously been barred from studying or teaching the islamic regime is grappling with mounting economic political and social pressures both at home and across the middle east particularly after the unexpected collapse of its key regional ally the syrian government of bashar alassad the regime has a long history of weathering crises and maintaining power but the convergence of domestic and foreign challenges has prompted questions about whether the leadership would respond by tightening controls over the population  or embracing reforms hardliners argue that the internet is a tool used by adversaries such as the us and israel to wage a soft war against the islamic republic reformists contend that repression only worsens public discontentpezeshkian who won the presidential election in july campaigned on promises to improve economic and social conditions with a particular focus on easing restrictions on womens dress and lifting internet censorship hardliners had imposed restrictions on platforms like x facebook youtube whatsapp telegram and instagram but iranians continued to access them through vpns widely available in domestic markets reformist politicians have accused hardliners of hypocrisy claiming some of them both enforce internet censorship and profit from the sale of vpns through alleged links with companies offering them ali sharifi zarchi a proreform university professor recently reinstated to his position described tuesdays decision as a first step that was positive and hopeful however he added it should not remain limited to these two platforms,25-12-2024 12:01,BalticsFox,Reddit,Modeling and Development

eta for all the people who think theyre so damn smart for pointing out this is from the christmas edition the christmas edition of the bmj is meant to be more lighthearted but still real research the entire point of my comment is that the research paper itself uses terminology thats misleading for what they are comparing and makes comparisons that arent meaningful for the variable age that they are supposed to be studying  the paper itself does a poor job of definitely exactly what they mean by older and why they think its meaningful terminology they do define older models as a version released further in the past but i think that could be misleading a model released further in the past could easily be seen as younger since its less architecturally complex and hasnt necessarily gone through the same volume of training compared to a more recent model that is building off of the previous generations i dont know enough to know exactly how the different generations of models are trained and when training stops for a given version of some model but i know enough to have questions about what exactly it is theyre comparing in the study after skimming through their methods and conclusions sections  i havent read it super closely all the way through so if i overlooked anything please comment to lmk as it is theyre mostly comparing completely different models chatgpt 44o claude gemini 115 but they arent comparing chatgpt 4 to versions 3 2 and 1 or however theyre numbered i think theyre trying way too hard to anthropomorphize the models and tie their study into the cognitive tests they use aiml models dont age as a natural consequence of time so the idea that some model being released further back in time is old in the same way that someone born further back in time is old is mostly just weird and confusing i think its an interesting study and it makes sense to do it for the sake of setting benchmarks for the models and seeing how they handle human cognitive tests but for someone coming from a computer science background id like to see a lot more space devoted to explaining the methodology from a technical perspective they have one data scientist listed as an author but im guessing they didnt have as much input as the medical people,24-12-2024 20:01,No-Information6622,Reddit,General Discussion

by kaye wiggins and mehul srivastava whatsapp has prevailed against israeli spyware maker nso group in a us lawsuit over nsos abuse of the messaging app to enable the infiltration of the phones of journalists activists and dissidents with its pegasus hacking tool a judge in the northern district of california ruled on friday that nso breached hacking laws and the terms of its service agreement with whatsapp by using the messaging platform to inject more than 1000 devices with its pegasus spyware the ruling in the civil case did not address the rights of the individuals whose phones had been hacked but it hands a victory to technology groups seeking to prevent their platforms from being abused by groups targeting their users  pegasus can read encrypted messages stored on a phone turn on its camera and microphone remotely and track its location its use has been tied to human rights abuses and the us department of commerce has blacklisted the israeli company the legal case was launched after a 2019 financial times report that coincided with whatsapps discovery that its services had been hacked by nso and pegasus the ruling said nso group did not dispute that it must have reverseengineered andor decompiled the whatsapp software in order to hack phones but had raised the possibility that it did so before agreeing to whatsapps terms of service however the judge found common sense dictates that nso must have first gained access to the whatsapp software and nso had offered no plausible explanation for how it could have done so without agreeing to the terms of service it ruled in favour of whatsapps claim that nso had violated federal and state hacking laws the judge also found that nso had repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery including in relation to the pegasus source code,23-12-2024 20:35,marketrent,Reddit,Critical Thinking

from the article on thursday a large group of university and private industry researchers unveiled genesis a new open source computer simulation system that lets robots practice tasks in simulated reality 430000 times faster than in the real world researchers can also use an ai agent to generate 3d physics simulations from text prompts the accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects walk or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time one hour of compute time gives a robot 10 years of training experience thats how neo was able to learn martial arts in a blink of an eye in the matrix dojo wrote genesis paper coauthor jim fan on x if an ai can control 1000 robots to perform 1 million skills in 1 billion different simulations then it may just work in our real world which is simply another point in the vast space of possible realities,20-12-2024 17:22,MetaKnowing,Reddit,Modeling and Development

 photobucket was sued wednesday after a recent privacy policy update revealed plans to sell users photosincluding biometric identifiers like face and iris scansto companies training generative ai models  the proposed class action seeks to stop photobucket from selling users data without first obtaining written consent alleging that photobucket either intentionally or negligently failed to comply with strict privacy laws in states like illinois new york and california by claiming it cant reliably determine users geolocation  photobucket risks huge fines if a jury agrees with photobucket users that the photostoring site unjustly enriched itself by breaching its user contracts and illegally seizing biometric data without consent as many as 100 million users could be awarded untold punitive damages as well as up to 5000 per willful or reckless violation of various statutes  if a substantial portion of photobuckets entire 13 billionplus photo collection is found infringing the fines could add up quickly in october photobucket estimated that about half of its 13 billion images are public and eligible for ai licensing business insider reported  users suing include a mother of a minor whose biometric data was collected and a professional photographer in illinois who should have been protected by one of the countrys strongest biometric privacy laws  so far photobucket has confirmed that at least one alarmed illinois users data may have already been sold to train ai the lawsuit alleged that most users eligible to join the class action likely similarly only learned of the conduct long after the date that photobucket began selling licensing andor otherwise disclosing class members biometric data to third parties  on top of users concerns about biometric data they fear that ai training on their photobucket images could also make it easier for ai models to create convincing deepfakes using their images or potentially regurgitate their images  like most users those suing let their accounts go dormant after photobuckets popularity waned postmyspaces peak theyve accused photobucket of launching a campaign of fraud and coercion hidden behind innocuous emails promising to safeguard user data but allegedly really functioning to spook as many inactive users as possible into opting in to new terms,12-12-2024 7:25,ControlCAD,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

 a locationtracking company that sells its services to police departments is apparently using addresses and coordinates of doctors and lawyers offices and other types of locations to help cops compile lists of places visited by suspects according to a 404 media report published today  fog data science which says it harnesses the power of data to safeguard national security and provide law enforcement with actionable intelligence has a project intake form that asks police for locations where potential suspects and their mobile devices might be found the form obtained by 404 media instructs police officers to list locations of friends and families houses associates homes and offices and the offices of a persons doctor or lawyer  fog data has a trove of location data derived from smartphones geolocation signals which would already include doctors offices and many other types of locations even before police ask for information on a specific person details provided by police on the intake form seem likely to help fog data conduct more effective searches of its database to find out when suspects visited particular places the form also asks police to identify the person of interests name andor known aliases and their link to criminal activity  a 2022 investigation by the electronic frontier foundation provided insight into fog data science and its fog reveal service as the eff wrote  fog data science is a company that purchases raw geolocation data originally collected by applications people use every day on their smartphones and tablets those applications gather location data about where your phone is at any given moment and sell it to data brokers who in turn sell it most often to advertisers or marketers who try to serve you ads based on your location thats where fog swoops in according to documents created by the company fog purchases billions of data points from some 250 million devices around the united states originally sourced from tens of thousands of mobile apps then for a subscription fee that many law enforcement agencies are happy to pay fog provides access to a massive searchable database of where people are located  services like fog data science have triggered concerns about how police might use location tracking to prosecute abortions for several thousand dollars annually the software lets police trace unique borders around large customized regions to generate a list of devices in the area police can use fog reveal to geofence entire buildings or street blockslike the area surrounding an abortion clinicand get information on devices used within and surrounding those buildings to identify suspects ars wrote in november 2022  the effs 2022 investigation found that fog obtained data from the firm venntel which is the subject of a federal trade commission action the ftc last week announced a proposed settlement with venntel and its owner gravy analytics the ftc alleged that gravy analytics and venntel violated the ftc act by unfairly selling sensitive consumer location data and by collecting and using consumers location data without obtaining verifiable user consent for commercial and government uses,10-12-2024 19:46,ControlCAD,Reddit,Energy and Problem Solving

researchers at google have built a chip that has enabled them to demonstrate the first below threshold quantum calculations  a key milestone in the quest to build quantum computers that are accurate enough to be useful the experiment described on 9 december in nature1 shows that with the right errorcorrection techniques quantum computers can perform calculations with increasing accuracy as they are scaled up  with the rate of this improvement exceeding a crucial threshold current quantum computers are too small and too errorprone for most commercial or scientific applications google uncovers how quantum computers can beat todays best supercomputers this has been a goal for 30 years said michael newman a research scientist at googles headquarters in mountain view california at a press conference announcing the feat the achievement means that by the end of the decade quantum computers could enable scientific discoveries that are impossible even with the most powerful supercomputers imaginable said charina chou the chief operating officer of googles quantumcomputing arm thats the reason were building these things in the first place newman added this work shows a truly remarkable technological breakthrough says chaoyang lu a quantum physicist at the university of science and technology of china in shanghai delicate states quantum computers encode information in states that can represent a 0 or a 1  like the bits of ordinary computers  but can also use infinite possible combinations of several 0s and 1s however these quantuminformation states are notoriously delicate explains julian kelly a physicist at google who leads the companys quantumhardware division to get a quantum computer to perform useful calculations you need quantum information and you need to protect it from the environment  and from ourselves as we do manipulations on it he says aiming for such protection  without which quantum computing would be a nonstarter  theoreticians began in 1995 to develop ingenious schemes for spreading one qubit of information across multiple physical qubits the resulting logical qubit is resilient to noise  at least on paper for this technique called quantum error correction to work in practice it would be necessary to show that this spreading of information over multiple qubits robustly lowered error rates over the past few years several companies  including ibm and amazons aws  and academic groups have shown that error correction can produce small improvements in accuracy234 google published a result in early 2023 using 49 qubits in its sycamore quantum processor which encodes each physical qubit in a superconducting circuit google uncovers how quantum computers can beat todays best supercomputers the companys new chip called willow is a larger improved version of that technology with 105 physical qubits it was developed in a fabrication laboratory that google built at its quantumcomputing campus in santa barbara california in 2021 as a first demonstration of willows power the researchers showed that it could perform in roughly 5 minutes a task that would take the worlds largest supercomputer an estimated 1025 years says hartmut neven who heads googles quantumcomputing division this is the latest salvo in the race to show that quantum computers have an advantage over classical ones and by creating logical qubits inside willow the google team has shown that each successive increase in the size of a logical qubit cuts the error rate in half this is a very impressive demonstration of solidly being below threshold says barbara terhal a specialist in quantum error correction at the delft university of technology in the netherlands mikhail lukin a physicist at harvard university in cambridge massachusetts adds it clearly shows that the idea works quantumcomputing endgame kelly says the teams results also suggest that this rate of improvement is sustainable and that it will enable future quantum chips to reach rates of one error per 10 million steps thats the level of accuracy that researchers generally see as crucial for making quantum computers commercially useful error correction is the endgame for quantum computing he says this is the quantum computer everyones imagined using achieving such a low error rate will require each logical qubit to be made of around 1000 physical qubits the company estimates  although further improvements in errorcorrection techniques could bring that overhead down perhaps as low as 200 qubits newman says researchers at ibm and other laboratories have also been making dramatic progress with schemes that require fewer qubits2 this shows that the field of quantum computing is reaching a critical juncture says lukin its really an exciting time nevertheless challenges remain says terhal in addition to building robust logical qubits researchers will need to network many logical qubits together so that they can share and exchange quantum states john preskill a theoretical physicist at the california institute of technology in pasadena who helped to develop the theory of quantum error correction says showing that errorcorrection schemes help to preserve the information in qubits was an important step but that correcting computational errors will be even more important we want to do protected qubit operations

 industrial ct scanner manufacturer lumafield imaged an omg pen testing usbc cable revealing sophisticated electronic components secreted within the connector lumafield product lead jon bruner shared on x formerly twitter a ct scan that revealed the interior of the omg cable showing advanced electronics and an antenna  a much more complicated design versus the amazon basic usbc cable that lumafield scanned for comparison security researcher mike grover created this pen testing penetration testing cable for fellow security researchers and hobbyists red teamers and for awareness training especially for highly vulnerable or targeted individuals  aside from the microcontroller and antenna lumafields indepth 3d ct scan revealed a second set of wires connecting a secondary die hidden under the primary microcontroller this detail is difficult to spot in the scan requiring some visualization parameter adjustments and a keen eye when the cable was passed through an ordinary 2d xray this secondary die was practically invisible allowing it to easily pass cursory inspection that means devices like this could conceivably pass through standard detection mechanisms  the omg elite usbc cable has several features that could allow anyone controlling it to take over any device plugged into it some of its features include keystroke injection mouse injection geofencing keylogging and more  lumafield said that it did this scan after it published the internal view of apples thunderbolt 4 usbc pro cable which revealed a lot of sophisticated electronics inside many wondered that if the tech giant could put such a lot of active components inside maybe someone could put malicious hardware in something as mundane as a usbc cable so lumafield decided to scan the omg cable to see how it hides its active electronics in such a tiny package  the companys scan shows how a supply chain attack can go undetected with electronics that look as simple as a charging cable getting more and more complicated every year anyone from runofthemill hackers to statesponsored attackers could get into the manufacturing process of a device and insert systems that will compromise the final product or worse  the good news is that these cables are expensive with prices starting at 11999 for the most basic version so you dont have to be worried about someone spreading this malicious hardware to provide widespread chaos among the public at large nevertheless its still better to be safe than sorry so bruner recommends that you purchase reputable charging cables sold by trusted stores and avoid public usb ports to charge your devices if you really need power onthego stick with the best usbc laptop chargers to avoid getting your devices compromised,06-12-2024 8:51,ControlCAD,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

thats a pretty limited view that seems like it doesnt fairly compare the two companies youre comparing blue origins short term goals with spacexs long term goals a better comparison would be between commercial viability of each company as a third party launch provider a government launch provider and space stations vs starlink spacex has already dominated the satellite market with starlink as well as with third party launch and government launch the falcon 9 fleet is already at near total market domination which by itself i think ng has a good chance at taking over starship however is coming really damn fast and there are only certain niches that ng is going to be able to keep for launch payload volume and price i think blue origin is going to hold on to a decent number of government contracts and third party launches simply out of diversification and for competitors that dont want to pay spacex to compete i dont think ng will get anywhere close to starship price to leo but i do think it will have a leg up for high deltav or deep space missions theres an advantage to being able to mount a craft on top of the final stage vs deploying out out of a payload bay i could be wrong but i havent seen too many vehicles be designed to deploy out of starship yet starship itself while making sense for mars colonization is highly inefficient as a deep space vehicle compared to something nonreuseable the potential ng third stage would also give it a leg up in that area all in all its also important to remember that the long term mars goal isnt focused on commercial viability spacex as a company is designed to use commercial success as a means to make mars happen not use mars as a short term cash cow this isnt just elons fantasy this is the primary goal that every spacex employee i know is working towards and believes in i think elon hate tends to make people think that this is all the whims of a billionaire but space colonization is a dream that goes way beyond him and is ingrained in human nature being a private company makes a goal like that possible because it doesnt need to be commercially feasible though i suspect it will still pay for itself in the end many times over,30-12-2024 17:00,lughnasadh,Reddit,General Discussion

blue definitely has a longterm future there will always be two heavylift providers for nasa and the department of defense dissimilar redundancy is a key element of the us spaceflight and national security strategy right now that is spacex and ula but vulcan is just not going to be competitive against a fullyreusable or even a partiallyreusable system at best vulcan may eventually be able to reuse engines but theres not all that much benefit to rebuilding all the tanking and instrumentation in order to refly engines blue is likely to either buy out ula and phase out vulcan or end up putting ula out of business with new glenn new glenn should be able to achieve the same missions as vulcan at less cost and a higher cadence because of full firststage reuse if blue can pull off a fullyreusable variant of new glenn that will be even bigger ula just cant compete in the new launch market because it takes them too long to build new boosters the idea of doing onorbit habitats is going to be a market but before we get to something like oneill cylinders we have to have the material sciences that can keep them from flying apart the stresses on a massive rotating object are bigger than you think we do not need future technologies to do mars colonization  we know how to make radiation shields we know how to build structures we have to scale up existing technologies to do it but not in ways that stretch the scientific limits thats not true with something like an oneill cylinder blues come a long way since dave limp became ceo and lit a fire under the companys collective asses but they still have yet to launch anything into orbit spacex is well on its way to developing a fullyreusable system blue has a lot of catchup to do at this point i would put money on blue being the second major launch provider but i would not put money on them leapfrogging spacex in the near future,30-12-2024 17:00,lughnasadh,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

probably yes its really about engineering now to advance engineering requires innovation and that innovation demands significant investment with no guaranteed profit in todays world everything has become much more profitdriven as an engineer i believe this focus on profit has stifled innovation to some extent the virtual world while generating a lot of money isnt offering much in terms of groundbreaking innovation the emphasis on quick returns and profitability has shifted resources away from longterm highrisk engineering projects that could lead to significant advancements simply companies are less willing to invest in projects that dont promise immediate financial returns in summary while there are still advancements being made the current economic environment prioritizes immediate profit over innovation which can slow the overall rate of technological progress,30-12-2024 14:58,ReinvigoratedSlouch,Reddit,Modeling and Development

technological advancement hasnt slowed down but its direction is increasingly shaped by profit motives and legal barriers like patents and copyright while these systems incentivize innovation by protecting intellectual property they also hinder progress by restricting access to foundational technologies patents can create monopolies and stifle competition while restrictive copyright laws limit collaboration particularly in fields like software and biotechnology this legal framework often prioritizes corporate interests over the collective advancement of society corporate research and development focuses primarily on profitable areas such as ai consumer electronics and renewable energy while less lucrative but critical fields like rare disease treatments or antibiotic development are underfunded as a result innovation tends to favor incremental improvements in marketable products rather than groundbreaking advancements to truly accelerate progress we need to address these systemic issues and create incentives that prioritize innovation for societal benefit not just shareholder profits,30-12-2024 14:58,ReinvigoratedSlouch,Reddit,Modeling and Development

for the absolute firm maximum you need to look at thermodynamic waste heat the thermodynamic waste heat of a humanlike entity is enough that if you have roughly 2 trillion people that will add enough heat to the planet to make it for lack of better words nasty this is the case even if all processes to keep these people alive comfortable and working are essentially 100 efficient which is impossible as well below that you have the maximum assuming sane technological efficiency limits and not wanting to add any meaningful amount of temperature from the thermodynamic waste heat of humans and their activities even assuming very very efficient technology and absolutely no emissions or other knockon effects youre now talking about some 800 billion or so just below a trillion i would say if you want a firm maximum number thats it just below a trillion above that no amount of technology can make it viable and comfortable after that you can start looking at each of the limitations one by one making food is one limitation we currently make enough calories for about 11 trillion people but a very substantial portion of that food generation gets wasted nearly all of our farming is very low efficiency in terms of calorie per acre and in terms of calorie per watt of energy theyre just very very very efficient in terms of calorie per labor if we use current best farming technology available that means greenhouse farming which yields some 5 times more calories per acre while using 10 the water and almost no hazardous chemicals this comes at the cost of not just being laborintensive but being intensive in specialized highcost labor it isnt economically competitive in the current market if you assume it becomes competitive then were talking about making enough food for 60 billion people with a smaller ecological impact than we currently have and using about the same land if you assume vertical farming or other innovations make food production more efficient in the future historically it pretty consistently has then you can increase this figure by whatever arbitrary value you want with that same limit of under a trillion being in place if you consider that earth has orbits and that people can live in orbit in habitats and that you can make food in habitats with very low gravity or none for some foods and consider that more efficient diets than our current ones exist notable example vegetarianism important note i am not myself a vegetarian then you can rump this number actually a little bit past the one trillion number so as far as food goes you can go pretty close to the thermodynamic limit if you absolutely must next is overall climate and well a netzero human is possible and a human who mostly uses things recycled from previous generations of technology is possible so here the sky truly is the limit if the technology is good enough and policies are good enough to ensure 100 netzero and no fresh extraction of resources there is no limit next is motivation why should a person want to live on earth rather than anywhere else once that becomes a viable choice and this is when the number plummets way down because there honestly kind of isnt a good reason being at the bottom of a deep gravity well and surrounded by an atmosphere is very bad for trade in time being on earth is likely to become equivalent to being on a landlocked nation and the number of people who live in those is fairly small and dropping may go down to de facto 0 eventually due to simple economic pressures,30-12-2024 2:52,madrid987,Reddit,Modeling and Development

honestly i get your point its kind of like putting all your eggs in one basket hoping that agi or asi will become some magical fix for everything including aging i think people get jazzed about the potential of advanced tech because it feels like were on the edge of something big but yeah pinning all hopes on it is risky theres a lot we dont know about agi and asi and predicting how itll affect things like aging is a bit of a shot in the dark when i think about ai i mostly see its strengths in pattern recognition and data analysis like it might help us understand the aging process more by sifting through massive amounts of data faster than we ever could but instantly curing aging i dunno feels like were skipping some steps there curing aging involves complex biological processes and tons of unknownsits not just about crunching numbers also theres the whole debate about ethics priorities regulations and how the tech will be used or controlled like even if agi figures out a breakthrough there are still hurdles to making it practical and available so while im into seeing where technology takes us i wouldnt bet everything on it as our onestopshop for reversing aging i mean it doesnt hurt to be optimistic but maybe with a pinch of realism seems like a more balanced approach or maybe im just overthinking it,29-12-2024 23:19,AdPossible7290,Reddit,General Discussion

there are many medical ais being tested and even sometimes used today in doctor visits around the us but its hardly advanced enough to take over or even advise doctors about what to do its actually mostly about documentation the most common example of ai is actually in writing patient notes where doctors must dictate out loud in specific medical language what findings and treatment plans are examples include freed which i know some doctors use but it still is far from perfect the ai tends to confuse small talk for pertinent medical information and still tends to hallucinate make up certain conditions and diagnoses so doctors always have to factcheck everything at the end of the day before submitting the notes we actually had a live demonstration of this in our med school where they broke down exactly why we cant rely on ai and notation software to faultlessly get everything down when trying to use it the patient visits sound so artificial and makes patients so confused,29-12-2024 12:48,chrisdh79,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

im sorry but the examples in that article are so shitty it hurts i seriously hope one sentence long open ended queries that could have a million different answers isnt how theyre attempting to use ai in the medical field ai is intelligent not omniscient i would assume you need to feed it as much information as possible regarding your body besides i ate tomatoe and now lips itch for it to give an accurate diagnosis and plan,29-12-2024 12:48,chrisdh79,Reddit,Modeling and Development
folks should treat ai as an assistant who can synthesize vast amounts of data but were born yesterday you have to be very specific and explicit like taking rainman to the casino you cant just let him walk in there you have to play and let him count cards and calculate odds microsoft calls theirs copilot for this reason if there is ai slop in healthcare it is due to providers not using it correctly like any other tool,29-12-2024 12:48,chrisdh79,Reddit,Modeling and Development
from the article every so often these days a study comes out proclaiming that ai is better at diagnosing health problems than a human doctor these studies are enticing because the healthcare system in america is woefully broken and everyone is searching for solutions ai presents a potential opportunity to make doctors more efficient by doing a lot of administrative busywork for them and by doing so giving them time to see more patients and therefore drive down the ultimate cost of care there is also the possibility that realtime translation would help nonenglish speakers gain improved access for tech companies the opportunity to serve the healthcare industry could be quite lucrative in practice however it seems that we are not close to replacing doctors with artificial intelligence or even really augmenting them the washington post spoke with multiple experts including physicians to see how early tests of ai are going and the results were not assuring here is one excerpt of a clinical professor christopher sharp of stanford medical using gpt4o to draft a recommendation for a patient who contacted his office sharp picks a patient query at random it reads ate a tomato and my lips are itchy any recommendations the ai which uses a version of openais gpt4o drafts a reply im sorry to hear about your itchy lips sounds like you might be having a mild allergic reaction to the tomato the ai recommends avoiding tomatoes using an oral antihistamine  and using a steroid topical cream,29-12-2024 12:48,chrisdh79,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

i dont foresee things changing very much for relationships at all there will be different websites or apps that claim to fix it and people will continue to meet in person at eventsclubs or through people they know the apps are more popular right now because people arent socializing the way that they used to if the apps arent working logically more people will leave their houses even if it makes them uncomfortable i dont foresee relationship structures or childcare changing drastically either i know a lot of people are complaining right now and i understand that things are more challenging than they have been but unless the middle and upper class truly stop purchasing and it impacts the economy big changes or interventions are unlikely fewer people are choosing to have children so there isnt a reason for anything to drastically change with childcarefinancial relationship structures it will take a few generations of people having less children and them being grown for there to be things like an abundance of unoccupied houses or a decrease in the economyproduction assuming something environmental or political doesnt cause a huge upheaval first,26-12-2024 18:30,No-Tour1000,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

this doesnt seem like the right place to ask such a question this is barely a question it is more akin to an observation regarding your own perception of how questions about knowledge are pursued epistemology is very consistent in reinforcing your own idea that uncertainty is a basis for new understanding but you challenge that this isnt done to your satisfaction there are fundamental principles of how logic is structured to consistently approach questions about the world around us but these fundamentals are also subject to criticism and change this very process is how the scientific method and similar tools have become so robust they are the result of the very process you propose not because of dogmatic rigidity there was a renaissance remember would you toss these tools aside just because they can be discarded perhaps you should dwell on the implications of your own question instead of considering aesthetics consider purpose and consequence,25-12-2024 2:51,50K_Icey,Reddit,Modeling and Development

private property is a social technology a behavior that emerges out of a natural selection process societies that behave that way tend to use scarse resources more efficiently and thus outprosper societies that dont it would become obsolete only when resource scarcity ceases to exist and that is much further ahead than you think were talking about things being as abundant and easy to get as the air you breathe thats why air is free its not just a matter of its production being fully automated a world where 99 of the jobs are obsolete is a world where it is extremely cheap to make stuff so people wouldnt need to work nearly as much in order to afford what they want or people will just develop new higher needs and new jobs will emerge of a nature where their automation would defeat their purpose ubi regardless if it actually makes sense or not is meant to be something to solve an issue that would no longer exist if 99 of jobs were automated how will we determine who gets to live in desirable areas thats an example of a thing that cant just be automated away its an area where property rights would still need to be a thing the alternatives you mention have already been tried across human history and respecting property is the one that came out on top notice that property rights where not designed by anyone in the same way that species werent designed they were the result of a long process of natural selection the current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can fairly compete advance and accumulate wealth its not a mere belief its objectively true that such a thing is possible and its actually happening to a certain degree whether people and im talking about anyone fully respect the rules that enable the system is a different thing,22-12-2024 21:24,Timely-Way-4923,Reddit,Modeling and Development

 the current system of property ownership is justified by the belief that people can fairly lol this isnt limited to property  the basic question is about the value of capital vs labour since the 70s the value of capital has grown faster than the value of labour this has lead to increasing class differences between those who have capital and those who only have labour all capital accumulates with those who have capital as capital creates value in its own right and faster than labour does in a future where ai renders 99 of jobs obsolete labour will be just about worthless and capital will be everything this will mean most people will have all of their income from taxes on capital the tax will be somewhere between 0 and 100 where doesnt really matter for the hypothetical assuming its not 0 the amount of capital some can accumulate during their life comes down to priorities and how much they can save comapred to their peers someone who might want a less desirable house when young will accumulate money faster and can buy a more desireable house when older the other factor that matters a lot is the value of property until now property has always gone up in most places this is not a given we will have a shrinking population pretty much a given which means more houses than people houses might not be a desireable asset in all places which might make housing affordable to buy depending on the distribution of capital taxes,22-12-2024 21:24,Timely-Way-4923,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

you guys are forgetting about the union contracts for voice actors that were just ratified video game voice actors recently negotiated contracts with 80 games following a monthlong strike led by sagaftra the agreements include provisions for artificial intelligence protections enhanced wages and safety measures to address vocal strain and performance demands these contracts require companies to obtain consent from performers before using ai to replicate their voices or likenesses additionally a tiered budget agreement was established to support independent developers while ensuring fair treatment of voice talent however negotiations with major publishers like disney and ea remain unresolved,22-12-2024 18:24,sorpaqq2011,Reddit,Big Ideas
regardless of opposing views here either because of computer resources needed or voice actor union contracts i think this will be coming soon npc dialogue and voices can be generated remotely on machines specialized for it now maybe locally on your platform in the not too distant future games will embrace free form dialogue between players and computer generated characters quickly how would voice actors handle creating millions of different dialogues in real time llms are actually very good at staying in character when generating dialogue for a given interaction when instructed to do so its laughable to think people will prefer scripted dialogues its like demanding live bands for movies once talkies came along,22-12-2024 18:24,sorpaqq2011,Reddit,Modeling and Development

there are a fair few issues here i believe the most fundamental one is the comprehension of the problem itself as expressed here  as humanitys capacity for destruction increases day by day so does the likelihood of humanity destroying itself whether that be nuclear war deployment of a highly effective biological weapon asteroid hitting earth global warming ai invasion etc these are all possibilities and we are not equipped to properly evaluate risk and act accordingly which is demonstrably not the case we evaluated in the 80s that we had an apocalyptic and immediate risk of destruction by nuclear war and then we disarmed to like a quarter the number of weapons a tenth the blast yield and furthermore reduced the number of immediate deploy weapons by a further order of magnitude weve made the nuclear apocalypse impossible its already not in the cards anymore and would take decades of focused rearmament before it is again to be clear that rearmament seems to be starting up as of this year this is just one example of a doomsday people think is hanging over us but isnt precisely because we did this thing people think were incapable of doing  biological weapons being the most dangerous imo whether that be intentional or accidental knowing that one little lab leak could end humanity forever should scare you i agree biological weapons are the most dangerous but there is no possibility of one literally ending humanity forever causing societal collapse sure honestly its even likely but ending humanity forever not in the cards no  covid19 should have been a wakeup call but everyone seems to have already forgotten and moved on if only it were more deadly it could of ended humanity it couldnt no absolutely not possible even if it was about as severe as respiratory coronaviruses can be honestly if it was it would likely have spread way less  now complete human extinction at once is unlikely imo whats more likely to happen is we face a series of crisiss that sets humanity back bit by bit but as we recover we face other crisiss again and again until eventually we dont have the capacity to recover to new peaks whether that be through resource depletion uninhabitable land due to nuclear winter global warming or ice age thats not entirely impossible but highly unlikely that would require every place and every society on earth to be impacted by each of those crisis and thats simply highly unlikely especially given that the world is already becoming less connected and would become far less so after even the first significant collapse event as a wild example the us midwest desertifying doesnt in any way impact the rebuilding of a civilization in the tibetan plateau and it only takes one making it for them all to make it  humanity seems destined for selfdestruction as nations compete relentlessly with little regard for our collective future while corporations driven by profit and speed sidestep regulations to outpace rivals often at the expense of sustainability and ethical responsibility you have correctly identified a problem here but misattributed its scale by several orders of magnitude and failed to notice the multiple instances of selfcorrection of this kind of problem already extant throughout history now as to the solution for this system to work it will require a new world order where all nations willingly or forcibly submit to will of the system i know that sounds dystopian as fuck but countries need some sort of international law and policy that is actually enforceable ideally they see that this is for the greater good and submit willingly almost none would what youre proposing as a solution is for a technofascist superstate to brutalize and conquer most of the world and of course being a belligerent fascist superstate will put pressures on its perfect problemidentifying system it will be in the superstates best interest to distort this mechanism to point towards convenient escape goats as doing so maximizes the states stability and ability to continue acting  and the priority of it doing so will be highest since they believe theyre the only solution welcome to reinventing the holocaust  this system will never be perfect but decreasing the margin of error as much as possible is the key this can of course be tested through calibration methods for it to work people need to be able to trust the system and for people to be able to trust the system it needs to be fucking right it doesnt no in fact it being right will often reduce how much people trust the system every time its right conclusions fly in the face of peoples biases and emotions recent history has so many cases of this that i need not elaborate this system will quickly and correctly identify that the optimal way to gain trust and hence stay in power is to validate and act upon peoples biases,22-12-2024 15:38,BreadfruitLimp9498,Reddit,Modeling and Development
i see where your heart is in this but dont be surprised when you receive negative reactions the root problem is that the organization of human society is incredibly complicated and there have been countless attempts to improve our society since the dawn of mankind all of these attempts looked good in theory good enough to inspire people to try them out but almost all just make things worse the devil is in the details and the unintended consequences and the common result is a lot of human suffering this is why you wont be taken seriously or even listened to there have been too many failed reformers that led us into death and misery and we have learned the incredible danger of this kind of wholesale societal restructuring the most successful method of making things better so far seems to be incremental change and focusing on one problem at a time this approach has its problems too notably the impatience of the governed and the slow response to emerging problems as for humanity self destructing i dont think any form of collective good sense decision making will ever prevent lone wolf radicals with more and more individual power from doing destructive things what happens when a mentally unbalanced individual has the ability to harm all of humanity without any checks or balances this is the real worry i think and i dont have any answer,22-12-2024 15:38,BreadfruitLimp9498,Reddit,Modeling and Development

urbanisation is not really booming anymore we are around 58 urban and the human population will barely grow forward by 2050 the un projects 68 urbanisation and although i think this is quite low 75 the level seen across most of europe seems like a good optimistic projection going from 58 to 75 urbaniation when our population will go from 82 to 95 will only increase the population in urban areas by 50 in 25 years thats a 15 annual growth rate at most that is not a lot actually the mass urbanization of the world is behind us the world population as a whole including declining rural areas was growing more than 15 a year before 2015 between 19602000 the urban growth rate was 45,22-12-2024 1:44,ramakrishnasurathu,Reddit,General Discussion

teacher here ive worked in a range of contexts from homeschooling to higher ed presently teach 57 grade at a relatively upscale private school i think something that most people dont understand about teaching middle school age specifically is how much of the work is engaging kids and dealing with challenges that are not directly academic like x is struggling with attentiveness during grammar lessons because they are struggling with their gender identity and parents are in conflict about this too but if you can woo them with the proper creative writing topic their engagement may increase over time and they may discover that there is something to this learning thing or y reads three to four grade levels below the norm but they struggle to ask questions and do everything to keep up appearances because theyre prideful getting parents to just engage with that reality is a multiyear team effort i could go on and on so when i read articles like this and some of the discussion around them its apparent to me that people miss the interconnected nature between core academic learning and so many other things going on in a childs life as well as how these play out unpredictably on a daily basis lecturing to middle schoolers is much more art than science i use generative programs in my teaching to help support student practice and what stands out to me is how bad these programs are at helping students who lie at the outer fifty percent of the bell curve they foster complacency in higher performers and frustration in lower performers theyre a tool that has their place but the limits to their adaptivity hinder them more than people realize will this improve absolutely but kids often need personal relationships to help them work through challenges or push themselves i feel as though the nature of these such applications as being created by engineers who are often selfstarters and selfdirected learners presupposes much of the same for the students they are working for i dont think five percent of the hundreds of individuals ive taught would properly succeed in such a setting no matter how good the tools just some musings ai is certainly a hot topic in education right now especially of the independent school variety and while it has its place and i am increasingly using it as a tool like a lot of tech hype its limits are overlooked and often misunderstood by those outside of the field,22-12-2024 0:53,MetaKnowing,Reddit,Modeling and Development

the idea that progress occurs according to a roadmap is misguided i believe this illusion stems from the scam that the semiconductor manufacturers came across back in the 70s when they realized they could continue shriking lithography just by using shorter wavelengths of light that game is over and the roadmap was just a corporate scam in truth progress itself is an illusion that springs from the enlightenment which was really a metaphor for european racist views on the world there is no progress as thomas kuhn explained in his book the structure of scientific revolutions in which he made the case that progress in science is simply an illusion created by people who take accidental discoveries and then create a narrative by which they appear to have been intentionally guided when it was never the case there is no roadmap and creating one is an exercise in authoritarian fantasy theres nothing wrong in doing so for entertainment but dont start worshipping it and offering sacrifices to it now what appears to be a glaring counterexample would be china and solar but thats not really a counterexample because the chinese didnt develop the polysilicon photocell based on a roadmap the roadmap was for streamlining the supply chain for an existing technology that was already well investigated and abandoned by the americans thats not the same thing as guiding progress although the results look similar but the process is fundamentally different in that you can see where youre going with an existing technology that youre trying to streamline the manufacturing of you cant do that with something you cant see and most real technological innovation takes place through a long series of missteps that cannot be predicted or planned the truth about discovery is that it is not a progress at all it is an exploration and these are two different things a progress procedes according to a plan but an exploration is more like something that might take place in the dark thick fog on the side of a hill with your hands bound behind your back blindfolded experimentation requires intuition you cant put that on a map progress is really a troubling concept in many ways because it obscures the workings of the experiments that lead to discoveries that actually become the basis of change,21-12-2024 22:41,Gari_305,Reddit,Critical Thinking

i think a system like this is evolving but it would take a major effort by a dedicated organization to make it happen sooner than later and the turmoil we see around the world due to environmental havoc suggests the sooner the better it would encounter major resistance from currently entrenched interests though their political power is getting weaker every day as those interests are unable to address global turmoil and major issues such as environmental protection economic issues etc i think the best way to implement such a system is to focus on building local consultative councils consisting of local civil society organizations csos and stakeholder delegates their main tasks would be to serve as a forum for local citizens to conduct community surveys to review existing and proposed legislation in a formal manner and then issue advisory opinions on such legislation ultimately it would propose legislation and then work with existing governments to enact them the councils would have three main parts the executive committee subcommittees on specific issues such as education health care industry labor etc and a permanent staff citizens would be encouraged to sit on a committee that aligns with their interests or offered incentives to join unpopular committees the permanent staff would be employees of a separate organization or foundation that assigns staff as needed to local councils they would handle the daytoday operations but would be nonvoting each council would have access to an ai that would assist the permanent staff in gathering and analyzing data current systems of governance that can serve as models include chambers of commerce the chinese peoples political consultative conference cppcc the international organization for standardization iso existing community councils and existing advisory boards or committees such as the council of economic advisers the council on environmental quality ceq et al the shortterm goal would be to formalize and implement such councils as widely as possible to encourage citizen participation and engagement the permanent staff would focus on meritbased leadership and developing effective daily operations the intermediate goal would be to make advisory opinions a required part of the legislative process the longterm goal would for such councils to replace or oversee existing legislatures  a good way to fill unpopular seats would be that new council members are appointed to a subcommittee for their initial term one or two years before they can submit their preferences popular seats would be filled through sortition  the ai would never have any decisionmaking ability it would at most be an advisor to the advisors the ai would belong to the staff organization and could consolidate information and proposals from local councils,21-12-2024 22:14,Straight_Picture_709,Reddit,Modeling and Development

chatgpt is just a language learning model it doesnt have knowledge its literally just regurgitating and paraphrasing scrapped knowledge off the internet from what hopefully qualified people have shared and it has no way of knowing if what its saying is accurate its whole job is just to approximate human language and writing to sound human not be knowledgeable about anything its not a replacement for learning or knowing therapists would definitely benefit from assistive ai models to help with productivity or other aspects of the job but trying to use generative ai as an assistant to fill in knowledge gaps sounds like a problem waiting to happen the reason the chatgpt response might have felt incredibly resonant with you is because it just told you what your problem was whereas most therapy is designed for you to figure out what your problem is through talking and being prompted to reflect in certain directions by a mental health professional who is ideally trained to take you safely on that mental journey without causing trauma the most common therapy modality used today is cbttalktherapy which isnt there to just give you the answer but hold up the mirror to guide you to them and therapists arent going to just tell you what your problem is even if they know within 5 minutes of talking to you are therapists actually incapable of helpingignorant about all the theories or are you expecting cbttalktherapy to function differently than it does because there are plenty of modalities in therapy they dont all work for everyone but cbt is the bread and butter for most therapists these days so if thats all youre encountering and its not effective for you its understandable why youd draw these conclusions just food for thought edit grammar,21-12-2024 16:30,csimpsonsfgc3,Reddit,Modeling and Development

so there is great potential here but the potential of any failures or poor quality interactions to cause great harm are significant enough that we cant say were at a point where this is reliably a good idea as others point out and as you seem to be aware op these systems are predicting what output they can create which is most likely to produce a thumbs up essentially from the human reviewer we are not at a point where any llm has been 100 trained by mental health professionals and peer reviewed scientifically for integrity and positive efficacy so sometimes it spews out what sounds good to laymen to general random people for example in fiction there is much exploration of rogue ai doing crazy stuff and saying kill your wife marry me and stuff like that this is the source of some of those kinds of hallucinations because the llm has learned that certain sensational things are appreciated by humans  for humor for fiction for thought exploration etc granted im grossly oversimplifying that statement but thats the basic giist  this is a reddit comment after all dont get me wrong not gonna lie i use it in some similar ways at times but im also an ai  ml solutions architect and have my own business around that though not a doctor im very interested in psychology i am wayyy more capable than most of understanding when it says something bogus and treating it as a tool and productivity accelerant without humanizing it or personifying it i know it can and does spit out crazy bullshit all the time so like there is potential here in its analytical capabilities partly due to its lack of human emotion interestingly enough as you cite however we need wayyy more experience with it in tightly controlled settings in directly oversight by and collaboration with medical professionals so we can really iron it out enough to have any safe and reliable ways for it to be used with the general population also  these problems and concerns are exponentially worse as you deal with increasingly significant  severe mental conditions the challenge gets exponentially more difficult and the potential harm does as well having it provide more neutral perspective on more mundane things is much more safe than someone speaking to it about trauma for example if anyone here wants an actionable takeaway its using current llms to potentially offer you different perspectives on matters that are not severe intense intimate traumatic etc like if you have a disagreement with a colleague at work and you want to run the details through an llm and collaborate on potential ways to best represent and advocate for your perspective whilst also asking the llm to play devils advocate and act as a lawyer or a debate participant and try to challenge you with countering perspectives and arguments that kinda stuff is i think much more appropriate for general public use at this point  so long as you still keep in mind llms can readily hallucinate get confused overwhelmed stuck on dumb shit in other words i use them extensively every day and every single day  every single day i witness various llms fail spectacularly and get stuck on dumb shit so to speak i have to wrestle and wrangle them and often abandon many chats so i can start fresh with a new context window each chat has a context window which is basically the short term memory of the llm you are chatting with it doesnt really permanently learn anything for example chatgpt memories are not learning so much as they are saved reminders which are constantly kept available so that as the context window fills up and overflows pushing in the newest part of the chat and pushing out the oldest then memories stay in their special spot on the side just for your account so its akin to learning but technically speaking is not the same mechanic that is used when we train the llm such as chatgpt to learn by reinforcement and etc which is ultimately incorporated into its dataset as we abstractly call it which is really a complicated system based upon a vector databse aka vdb but you can just call it dataset or training dataset as we commonly refer to it in the industry,21-12-2024 16:30,csimpsonsfgc3,Reddit,Modeling and Development

this is a very abstract concept and series of questions so theres not really one single comprehensive answer short answer it depends it depends on how the simulation is built some simulations can be exited some cannot building simulations there are infinitely many different ways but they all generally can be considered on the spectrum of physical law approximators effectively just mathematical calculations of rules determined to be the laws of the simulated domain some simulations like for example ones that i personally have built or pretty much all video games are extremely simple in nature having very low physical resolution ie how detailed they are in approximating physical laws as technology grows we basically throw more computing power at the problem and figure out ways to do more calculations effectively making the simulated content more accurate to the expected outcome i assume youre really asking about the end of the spectrum the extremely high resolution simulations that we see movies or read books about in which case were pretty close to being able to simulate at that level maybe 525 years in my opinion quantum computing may help in this domain but honestly depending on the scale ie how big you want a world to be we have the technology its really about the computing resources used and the level of effort it takes to code can you put your neighbors in a simulation again depending on how detailed you want to get and how much effort you are willing to spend yeah in theory you could hypothetically clone them by training ai on their data if you had access to that and inserting them into a world you generate i have to imagine the level of detail youre talking about however is out of reach of most people for many years,21-12-2024 13:34,essecarthaginem,Reddit,Modeling and Development

we could exit the simulation in the same way an ai could get out of a computer assuming the conditions are there for it to do so an ai could learn how the computer works then use the wifi connection to transmit itself to a more capable host i quite like the idea that it could hop from one internetconnected device to another until it finds something capable of selfreplicating eg a humanoid robot or a 3d printer at that point an ai that was once confined to a computer is walking around amongst us by the same logic wed have to learn enough about the rules of our simulation then activate something that can communicate with the outside only then would we be able to learn enough about the containing universe to step into it obviously making many many assumptions here about what would be possible,21-12-2024 13:34,essecarthaginem,Reddit,Modeling and Development
fun and games if you find out that you are a simulation then logically you would want to break out into the real world whatever that might be you dont really worry about the nature of that real world since you know that the equipment to simulate you can exist in that world but you would want to guarantee that the beings running the simulation you live in dont turn it off that is you may have to wipe them out then if you live in a simulation you need to find out if that real world is really the real world or just another level of simulation rinse and repeat and hope its not an infinite stack,21-12-2024 13:34,essecarthaginem,Reddit,Modeling and Development

ive known about lightmatter for years and i doubt they will have a general digital photonic compute device within decade i doubt anyone will have one everyone who is talking about photonics today either offers no computation at all its analog based or they lie to get investment money doing digital computation using light requires for said light to be able to interact with itself and this is not possible without a medium mediating such interaction as light is known for not interacting with itself even if materials with appropriate optical properties were found it doesnt guarantee that it would yield scalable computing technology after all modern silicon devices have features much smaller than visible light wavelenght which would force the use of much shorter wavelenghts which are not easy to work with switching speed of light is also meaningless outside of communication as the frequency of a chip would be limited by the optical medium switching and not the light switching the best way to measure whether photonic computing is anywhere near being released to the market is to look at what the big players in chip design do instead of listening to what start ups promise and fail to deliver from my point of view superconducting computing has much better chance of actually being useful anytime soon but even this feels 15 to 20 years away also quantum computing while a somewhat different thing is leagues ahead of either photonic or superconducting computers in terms of having an actual product on the horizon,21-12-2024 4:18,Walter1607,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
i made a whole post about this very same topic and although highly speculative my theory was that photonics will eventually displace electronics completely and not just single components such as chips but entire systems themselves thereby rendering current forms of electronics obsolete what i am basically saying if it is not clear is that we learn to play around with light which is another wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum instead of electricity and we use light to do work instead of electricity at that point even the word electronics would stop making any sense because all devices at that point would no longer be using electricity directly anymore unfortunately the things that i talk about and foresee such as optical data and power transmission optical power storage and optical wiring is not currently feasible together as a single unit only bits and pieces are possible right now such as our current early forms of photonic chips and fiber optic wires i dont know how long it would take to do something like what i envision it could take 2030 years it could take 50 or even 100 years nobody knows maybe agiasi could help us significantly speed up the timeline to developing this nascent technology now if we are to assume that photonics are superior to current forms of electronics it stands to reason that quantum devices are the next leap after that but there is no way to know for certain though what this would look like maybe it might be a new form of circuitry like what photonics seems to require or it might just be a new type of subprocess or ability within the system that we didnt know was possible that could require only minor hardware tweaks,21-12-2024 4:18,Walter1607,Reddit,Modeling and Development
traditional computers will be more than adequate for home use for many many decades to come photonic computers will probably do the heavy lifting in big datacenters and will ultimately trickle down to the consumer market quantum computers are useless as general computational devices they will be used for very specific types of computations that are not realistically feasible with the more traditional systems mentioned above theoretically we could have normal computers with some quantum computing unit similar to a modern gpu in some far distant future finally there is the option of hybrid computing where sone of the workload is offloaded to the cloud however that also brings its own set of limitations,21-12-2024 4:18,Walter1607,Reddit,Energy and Problem Solving

can somebody explain the price mechanisms to me i assume that because of low demand due to that early time of morning and excess supply during the same period that the people who are prepared to buy electricity at that time are being paid to purchase it hence negative price who is paying them do they producers get paid as well would love to understand how our energy pricing works because they always seem to be high regardless,20-12-2024 13:53,chrisdh79,Reddit,Finance and Deals
practical engineering just did a video that explains negative pricing  linked to the section but the whole thing is good as i understand wind and solar can make money from subsidies so they can bid negative the bids are selected from lowest cost to highest until demand is met the last bid to be accepted to meet demand is the price all producers receive called the clearing cost so unless theres 100 of demand met by renewables bidding negative they were still paid for the power thats why your bill doesnt go negative they just submit negative bids to get paid even pennies uh well that and for profit energy companies but idk how things work in the uk,20-12-2024 13:53,chrisdh79,Reddit,General Discussion

theres already work on the fringes of this if you consider the creation of new elements to be femtotech ive often wondered if they do create super heavy stable elements if they might have unique properties that could be utilized for instance if the outer nucleon shells do anything like proton conduction resembling electrical conductors that would possibly allow for the creation of tiny nuclear tractors and create a whole new tech field just speculation though i dont know enough about quantum chromo dynamics to know if it could work or not,18-12-2024 18:17,UniversalAssembler,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

the following submission statement was provided by uchrisdh79  from the article as if the us werent polarized enough a new real estate app promises americans the opportunity to retreat even further into politically siloed communities by screening their potential neighbors for unwanted party affiliations the oyssey app which bills itself as a real estate search management platform includes a feature that allows wouldbe homebuyers to assess the political leanings of their potential neighbors before moving in beyond standard search filters oyssey pioneers never before available blockbyblock social and political data the apps website reads the platform sources that information from election results and campaign contributions along with housing trends and other social data the new york post writes its about getting buyers homes that they love oysseys ceo huw nierenberg told axios which wrote about the apps unique feature nierenberg has also said hes on a mission to democratize home search data oyssey which is a fairly new company and only recently soft launched in south florida and new york city this october also provides users with a host of other local demographic data including information on the age education and income of potential neighbors one of the more intriguing data points oyssey offers is the ability to tell how many dogs live in your neighborhood if you live in a place like new york city this is genuinely useful information either a you like dogs and you want to know where you can see as many as possible or b you dislike having to sidestep dog crap whenever you leave your apartment and would like to know where they are least likely to reside overall a good feature when it comes to the political screening element of oysseys offerings there is obviously more to be worried about on the one hand you can see why homebuyers would want this kind of information who doesnt want to know who their neighbors are on the other hand it might not be such a great idea to incentivize people to only live with people who are already like them plus in a place like new york city i dont think youre going to be getting a whole lot of political variety anyway  please reply to ops comment here ,18-12-2024 16:25,chrisdh79,Reddit,Modeling and Development

no i dont think the tech is there and im skeptical it will ever be there not because its impossible but because youll have to test it on a bunch of fetuses who will develop poorly because the tech initially wont work properly and youd have a bunch of sick babies until the tech is perfected and humans wont have the stomach to mass produce ill babies until the tech is perfected,18-12-2024 16:19,WanderingSondering,Reddit,General Discussion
some people for sure all people probably not i think generally humanity is more diverse and resists becoming uniform if artificial wombs become a thing and many or most people use them  there will also be naturalistscounter movements that reject such methods similar to the question why we should keep our natural limbsbodies when one day robotics is so advanced that a artificial arm or whatever is better in every way then for sure some people will just get the artificial arm but others keep their natural one because it is doing just fine enough in any case i assume that medical technology will advance such that natural pregnancybirth might become safereasier etc too we will see,18-12-2024 16:19,WanderingSondering,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

op your headline is inaccurate the novel part of this isnt helping the embryo mature its helping the egg mature the fertilo procedure differs from traditional ivf because it takes ovarian support cells oscs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs and cocultures them with an immature egg to mimic the natural egg maturation process in the lab a 2023 study showed that this method significantly improved egg maturation and embryo formation gameto says the fertilo procedure avoids 80 of the hormone injections that traditional ivf requires and reduces the duration of a treatment cycle to three days this is actually pretty huge follicle stimulating hormones are a huge chunk of what makes ivf so expensive stimming is also the most uncomfortable part of the process for most women and this would seemingly nearly eliminate the risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome,18-12-2024 12:07,chrisdh79,Reddit,Modeling and Development

my vote is for ar paired with an earbud once we have good tech for those things your phone will go in your pocket and there it will stay shortly after that you will just buy a computer that fits in your pocket and it wont have more than a rudimentary display for pairing devices i think developers are going to need a decade or two of coding and tweaking features on ar before our control over our tech environment really starts to branch out and expand after that ar is a replacement for your phones main feature the screen maybe you will still use the phone as a control interface while they nickel and dime everybody on every tiny iteration but once you stop staring at the damn thing all day long it will lose its relevance rapidly adblockers are going to be so much more important in the future,18-12-2024 2:44,Slimydog21,Reddit,AI and Tools

i think youre wrong smart phones or something very much like it will be a staple for the rest of the time technologically advanced society exists consider the button tech companies have been trying to replace it for decades they were gonna do it with touchscreens then with voice commands now the car interfaces you reference are literally seeing a return to buttons and knobs because people actually prefer the experience of using them relative to the higher tech alternatives we always think just because something is higher tech that it is destined to replace alternatives but this isnt the case higher tech doesnt just need to work it has to work significantly better than whatever it is replacing on top of that humans brains are still primitive in a lot of ways we like pressing shiny raised buttons because our brains are still wired to pick out shiny round berries and nuts our current interfaces feel primitive compared to how our brains actually process information were spatial creatures who think in 3d yet were constrained to tiny 2d windows into the digital world i think youre giving our brains too much credit we think in abstractions and 2d abstractions are more efficient for most purposes consider maps we have 3d maps they exist how often do you use them im willing to guess never for most people because the third dimension is generally unnecessary this is the case for most things you do on your phone in fact remember when video calling was going to replace all phone calls youd see in sci fi every call was a video call where they could see the persons face what happened to that were technologically capable of itbut we dont need it for most phone calls we dont want or need to see the persons face even a 2d image was more than was necessary and most people just stuck to the efficiency of voice calls especially when it comes to devices we dont want more unnecessary fluff we want what gets the job done was conveniently and efficiently as possible and phones are amazing for that the only possible alternative is the ar glasses of the future that do everything a phone does in a transparent hud i think this is a false expectation as well for the reasons ive already mentioned moving all the same information your phone gives you into 3d isnt going to be a significant stepup on top of that humans are really concerned with appearances and our faces are the most sensitive parts of our body and human experience convincing everyone to wear a peripheral on their face is not an easy sell so youd need some use case that is really compelling to make it happen well fiddle with anything in our hands though dont believe me take a random object with you onto the street and try to hand it to someone they are likely to take it ask the same people to rub that object on their face and they will likely become angry and suspicious of you computerbrain interfaces are going to face similar hurdles i dont think anyone is anticipating sure controlling an interface with your thoughts sounds cool to techsavvy people but the average person doesnt want to learn tech mindwizardry to make a phone call and the moment they call someone inadvertently by accidently thinking about it theyre gonna trade in their cbi for a good old smartphone that has the barrier of intention that is their fingers without having to relearn how to move,18-12-2024 2:44,Slimydog21,Reddit,General Discussion

the smartphone as we have it was really a convergence of devices that already existed after all that was the premise of steve jobs introduction of the device on the one hand we have the clear line of development of onthego entertainment from the walkman through to the ipod that served as one element of the modern smartphone the separately is the mobile communication device again the development of the cellular telephone has a similarly long history with early basic analogue cellular phones dating from the 1970s as they developed they too gained more functionality text messages came in with gsm and subsequently both games basic apps and basic data services followed as the internet allowed phones like the t68 had email support basic calendar apps and even an addon basic camera paper based systems for having all the information i need with me like the filofax date from the 1980s and were digitised with the pda in the late 1990s the moden smart phone is in essence the bringing together of these three sets of tools into a single convergent device likewise pocket cameras have a long history and digital portable cameras were very much a thing before smart phones what the smart phone did was bring these separate and already established devices together and combined them into a single object eliminating the need to have multiple discrete portable devices for specific tasks the core feature of this line of development is moving from multiple single purpose devices into a single unified device because having everything in one place is just more convenient than having lots of separate ones if we see a proliferation of connected devices that provide for natural ways to interact with digital information i do not see them as replacing the phone at all but as being peripherals to it that can be used as needed and as available the phone the name is anachronistic but thats what we call it is the computing core that drives all of these things while the alternative is to have everything in the cloud and all the devices connect to that i dont think the business model needed to support that model of everthingasasubscriptionservice is going to win out we have seen too many examples of useful devices ending up bricked when the cloud back end they depend on gets discontinued and shut down,18-12-2024 2:44,Slimydog21,Reddit,Modeling and Development

meritocratic systems assume we live in an equitable society which we dont gender race class upbringing sexual identity and many other factors influence the shape of ones life to the point i wanted to write about what it means that some people seemingly have to earn or do something to deserve access to things that we think about as basic necessities so how hard can you work to earn access to a meal every night or like what do you have to do to deserve a good education what do you have to do to deserve to have housing and thats one of the ways that race sort of works in this country is that theres some people that are deemed inherently worthy  the government doesnt have an incentive to help people because people are complex and moving the problem of people is simple and profitable for the companies theyre in business with they get more police budget pay private companies for homeless sweeps to the tune of 100m  and create pathways towards prison that support the private prison industry and services this is why we have the supreme court decision for grants pass  criminalization is more profitable that helping people and has more lobbying support behind it because companies also get cheap labor to make food and goods sold in the us so companies dont have to pay minimum wage or higher while not all unhoused folks have drug addiction or mental illness creating a label that makes them an other means it is easier for us to be ok with dehumanizing policies like the ones above where peoples wheelchairs and belongings they literally cant afford to replace away and assume there is something fundamentally wrong with them the stigma this label creates makes it harder to even implement solutions like tiny houses or putting people up in hotels because as a society we now view homelessness as a moral and meritocratic failure where you just didnt have the fortitude like the rest of us when really the unique set of life circumstances and resources needs to be considered every person who has a drug addiction started out as a kid or adult with goals or dreams or an idea of what their life would look like or maybe not ill make an assumption about many of the people who ended up on this sub or thread and assume that you likely  have someone you could turn to for money in a financial emergency or had jobs and life circumstances that allowed you to have savings  had medical insurance or financial support if you dealt with medical emergencies or ongoing health issues  learned life skills like money management and professionalism from someone in life  if you use drugs your use is considered acceptable or you know someone with an acceptable drug addition addiction honestly with the constant stress and anxiety of being unhoused im not surprised folks drink or use drugs and dont judge them for it we all probably use them or know people who use them for a lot less frequent and intense experiences people need stability and agency which housing and money provide making the assumption that unhoused people have created their conditions and just need more discipline ignores a deep set of social economic political and cultural factors many societies currently existing today and for thousands of years have provided for people regardless of their past current and future conditions and abilities rather than let someone suffer struggle or die out of a recognition of their basic dignity and humanity where they shouldnt have to prove or earn the right to live my hope is that our sense of the future will recognize this and move away from further mechanization and merit that flattens us as individuals by forcing us into a passfail mentality around whether we deserve a bed or food,17-12-2024 20:41,alivenotdead1,Reddit,General Discussion
im so glad that some other commenters have responded to this post heres the problem with the proposed solution homelessness is often in fact usually a symptom of many challenges including but not limited to poor mental health poor physical health addiction mental or physical disability substance dependency poor communication skills social isolation low reading ability poor language skills lack of confidence learning difficulties childhood trauma distrust of authority family breakdown misdiagnosis criminal exploitation i could go on these problems cause or exacerbate homelessness and homelessness often precipitates or amplifies these difficulties even more tricky is when multiple challenges interact with each other in ways that obscure whats going on while the voluntary system proposed by op could perhaps address is the vanishingly few homeless people who are focused capable and motivated right now and who need a structure to step onto it fails to address the main bulk of the problem homelessness a symptom of a complex system of interacting problems and the first rule of systems thinking is that when you intervene into a complex system you cant do just one thing sure you can try tobut the nature of complex systems is that your one simple intervention will have multiple often confounding effects it is frustrating to deal with complexity we have been poorly served by our educations and not taught well about it we instinctively want there to be a simple definitive action that if we apply it rigorously with military discipline indeed it will solve the problem the trouble is complex problems just arent like that they require addressing on all scales from the local to the global with multiple interventions that are constantly monitored and adjusted so where to start i suspect that the first thing to do to address homelessness is to get information from localities and to empower and resource localities to understand exactly whats going on there and address it in many cases it will be the details that matter as programmes progress helping localities to learn from each other will be key programmes of intervention will need to change and develop as they progress but whatll it cost less than the money wasted by failing as a society to empower people to contribute to it every homeless person who becomes housed cared for and gainfully or voluntarily employed turns a net loss into a net benefit,17-12-2024 20:41,alivenotdead1,Reddit,Modeling and Development

another article that touches on this topic by astral codex ten  summary 1 if something is bound to happen eventuallylike a person getting older or a technology reaching a dangerous thresholdearly warnings are natural when you see someone raising concerns too soon it often just means theyre trying to stay ahead of the curve rather than waiting until the last second 2 repeated early warnings can look like false alarms making it tempting to dismiss all future cautions but that misses the point the person warning you may not know exactly when the risky moment will arrive only that it will eventually being early doesnt mean theyre wrong just that we havent hit that moment yet 3 treating every early caution as a failure sets you up to ignore genuinely useful signals if the event really is inevitable ignoring all warnings because some were premature leaves you vulnerable its like unplugging your smoke alarm because it chirped a few times when you were just cooking dinner 4 a better approach is to absorb these cautions thoughtfully keep them in mind weigh them against new information as it comes in and dont give in to the urge to dismiss them wholesale maintaining some level of preparedness is usually safer than insisting on certainty before you take any action,15-12-2024 14:39,katxwoods,Reddit,Modeling and Development

one example is the effect that social media has on teenagers theres been research showing a huge increase in depression isolation etc jonathan haidt is an excellent professor and researcher who has looked into this and advocated for parents to restrict phone time and social media below certain ages also there is evidence that social media companies were still targeting younger people with ads despite being aware of these things this has lead to a recent law passed in australia banning the use of social media by anyone 16 and under theres still things to figure out on how to enforce this but similar laws are likely going to be proposed and adopted by many more nations now but to your overall point its true that it impacts everyone its hard to fight distractions ive had to remove certain apps from my phone use screen time to impose limits and other things just to try and minimize issues ive had and stay productive novelty provides dopamine so it can be habitual to seek it unfortunately i dont think i retain a lot of what ive learned and ive noticed ive rationalized learning about x our y because i felt it was important in some way only to later realize it really wasnt its a consistent modern struggle many people have now,13-12-2024 23:54,alxpht,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

such an undertaking would be less of a tree and more of a spiderweb the size of the internet with near endless iterations to arrive at a particular point because of the nature of knowlege in many cases using metaphor being context dependent in other words there is often more than one way to know something so there would be many paths leading to any particular node for example descartes used the metaphor of life as a machine which had a large impact on how we talk about describe and vizualize cellular biomechanics even when it is not the most accurate metaphor there are other understandings of the nature of cellular functioning that incorporate probability random walks ect that are more advanced and arguably correct but having both a philosophical and a physicsbased branch leading to the node for cellular biomechanics would make the concept of a tree very messy and thats just a basic example i think for such a tool to be genuinely useful to learners it would need to be more targeted to a specific subdicipline and make large clear concessions essentially being incomplete,13-12-2024 23:01,TwoplankAlex,Reddit,Modeling and Development

im going to bet we are not going to see anything meaningful the idea of harvesting he3 from lunar regolith breaks down the moment you try to quantify the engineering requirements when used in a fusion reaction with deuterium helium 3 has a energy yeild of about 24 gigajoules per gram while it is significantly more abundant in lunar regolith moon dirt the actual amount of he3 present is about 24 parts per billion so to get 1 gram of he3 you would need to process over 416 kilotons of regolith and that assumes a process that is 100 efficent at extracting and capturing it so there is no conceivable way that strip mining that much regolith can be done in a way that any rational person could describe as non destructive and this all ignores the fact that we dont have a practical fusion reactor that can use he3 as a fuel he3 can be made by bombarding lithium with nutron radiation and waiting a few years for the resulting tritium to decay this process is very scalable just place some lithium containing elements in the core of existing fission reactors or line the walls of a fusion reactor running a deuterium duterium reaction or just stick with the dueterium based reactor because its very likely the cost of using such a rare and hard to obtain element as fuel completely out weighs the extra efficiency from the more energetic reaction,12-12-2024 16:38,Gari_305,Reddit,Modeling and Development

i lived in japan for a few years female friends knew that as soon as they were married there would be intense pressure to have a child and drop their careers women who continue to work while having a child are judged harshly by other mothers as not being devoted enough meanwhile many companies will not hire married womenmothers due to the expectation that they will not be devoted enough to their jobs due to their many obligations at home add on the fact that the average single income from the husband isnt enough to rear a child these days and women are in a really difficult position my female friends were almost all on the same page single life was the only way they could make enough money to live while still having some freedoms on top of that japanese companies are so demanding of their workforce that men will be expected to spend nearly their entire day there i heard of families where husbands and wives saw each other only a few hours a week creating really lonely existences for women stuck alone in the home basically married life is extremely unattractive for women due to social attitudes and being single with a child is even worse its frustrating the government is not focusing on the right issues to solve these problems im sure thats only a piece of the whole puzzle but thats one of the most common reasons i heard for why women were not having kids,11-12-2024 23:13,madrid987,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

it is interesting is it not many shifts along cultural sociological and economical lines have led to declining birth rates globally every society that manages to develop into a wealthy one has been following this trend without fail we might as well assume that this is a natural law as unshakeable as the existence of gravity on earth is while i do believe that a smaller human population long term can be a good thing we are left with figuring out how we can sustain large amounts of elderly populations,11-12-2024 23:13,madrid987,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
this is apparent but not exclusive to japan its the new normal worldwide and we need forward looking politicians and world leaders to make this happen rather than fixing birth rates the policies need to gradually ease into a new model that doesnt rely on birth rate for taxes for a countries survival real estate can be recycled on tenures with a reversionary interest to the state consumption especially medical consumption will be significantly lower once the majority of the 70100 age range tapers off over the next 10 years this new normal isnt that far off but with world leaders still obsessed with birth rates how progressed are we to really face this within the next decade then we have the biggest enemy of all everincreasing lifespans and not enough taxpayers to pay their medical benefits i wonder if more countries will adopt euthanasia by this point to allow merciful and dignified ways of dying instead of being an elderly at that point and hiding at home waiting to die because i wouldnt be able to afford healthcare edit i millennial would be one of those elderlies who wont be able to afford healthcare by that point but i do look forward to a less overstuffed earth,11-12-2024 23:13,madrid987,Reddit,Modeling and Development
one thing that people dont mention about the social and economic aspect is uncertainty i will only speak from the usa perspective im making about 40000 in usa and i am actually pretty okay with my standard of living if i was making just a bit more more aligned with the average in my midsize city or had someone else who made the same income i think i could afford a child today if i really needed to take care of one so at least in the usa it is true that it is not a completely economical problem but the problem is that life changes too fast nowadays society eighteen years ago feels completely different from society now and while things have always changed i feel like its faster and were more aware of it i could lose my job rent can become too expensive regardless of your political views the next government is going to be very different from the current one that is a really big change to go through every four years and ai might take all our jobs if i want a child i want to have relative certainty that i can provide good basics to them for at least eighteen years and at most the rest of our lives simply food and a roof etc  and i cant actually guarantee that at all for me that is a greater huddle than anything else if i could guarantee that a child could have the life that i am having right now and again i make average salary and have an average job it would be okay the thing is our parents thought we would have their life and we did not and i am selfaware that our kids will not have our lives and it may be much worse that isnt something a shortterm government program can fix that is something we would fundamentally have to change about the society,11-12-2024 23:13,madrid987,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

so there are two issues the first is childcare this should be solved at a government level govt has heavy financial incentives to better build out the birthhighschool graduation period aka socialized daycare and summer camps lot of good data showing this has good outcomes and is also profitable the second is lack of third places we really dont have them that arent schools or churches it really is just gyms and parks that somewhat fill these niches gone are the days of malls cheap arcades etc this is a liability issue but also just a big funflation issue i think expanding the park systems would be a good place to do this as well as subsidize large club type places think ymca boxing gyms yoga studios sports etc type classes and somewhat help limit the liability because liability is the big reason why these sorts of things have tried up and gotten really expensive this could also be some sort of addon to the school systems open school facilities on weekends for example,10-12-2024 14:13,AmbassadorAdept9713,Reddit,General Discussion
many of us are happy without a lot of children i had one and i was perfectly happy not going for another it wasnt about expense per se i didnt want to have to move to a bigger place or have to drive different kids to different schoolsevents or spend my saturdays at sports games or have to attend so many parent teacher conferences i already did those things and i am lucky to have a village  there are 3 other boys my childs age on the block and weve had an open door policy for each family having a child has been an incredible joy but life is nice with the one i have and i have several friends who enjoy their lives without children they have enough money and time but just dont feel the need now that women have more choices about reproduction well many are happy choosing one or none,10-12-2024 14:13,AmbassadorAdept9713,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

for some context the problem they are talking about here is called random circuit sampling it is not practically useful for anything it is designed specifically to give the greatest possible advantage to quantum computers just to demonstrate that they are actually doing something that classical computers cant the problem goes like this create a completely random quantum circuit and then sample an output from running that circuit on a quantum computer so for a quantum computer you just do that but for a classical computer there is no great way to simulate an arbitrary quantum circuit that doesnt have any particular structure so it will by default be very very slow besides being practically useless another problem with this approach is that it is essentially impossible to verify that the output of your quantum computer is correct you just have to run it on small circuits that you can simulate first check that it is working and then assume that it keeps working when you scale up to more qubits anyway this is not to down on google they have made a ton of progress here but the sensationalist headline stuff oh my god we calculated this thing that takes a trillion years or whatever is not actually very helpful at explaining what they have done because it is not a calculation that anyone really needs done in the first place and the calculations we actually would like to do still cant be done on this computer,09-12-2024 20:20,Imaginary-Passion-95,Reddit,Modeling and Development

have they effectively broken encryption going forward  no they beat a very specific benchmark that is on one hand impressive but the benchmark is kind of built to be the one specific problem where quantum computers are much more efficient than classical beating this problem does not necessarily mean anything for realworld problems and to reiterate  quantum computers do not solve problems by trying all solutions and finding the right one the closest thing to that is grovers algorithm but that is not really worldshattering it just gives you a nice speedup there are some cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to quantum computers mostly public key schemes that are not built on lattice assumptions but quantum computers do not help you that much with breaking symmetric encryption finding preimages of hash functions breaking anything built on lattices and so on okay grovers algorithm gives you some speedup but nothing you cant protect against by doubling your security parameter dont get me wrong getting better results at quantum error correction right is a step towards more effective quantum computers but to frame this as cryptography now broken is nonsense,09-12-2024 20:20,Imaginary-Passion-95,Reddit,Energy and Problem Solving

if you are nontechnical and trust the dev agency to fulfill your dreams it most likely will be hard be very precise about what you need like i want feature a that does b blabla the more precise your specs the more happy you will be with your results i often think of having a mediator with a business backgrounddomain knowledge but also software background as a checkpoint is a good way to ensure the dev agency will do what you really want,30-12-2024 20:12,Jaspernalu,Reddit,Modeling and Development
if you are building a saas company you will definitely need a tech cofounder unless you are comfortable enough around that area yourself working with agencies will have a pretty high fail rate unless you have someone very technical to specify and oversee the whole project,30-12-2024 20:12,Jaspernalu,Reddit,General Discussion
long term you definitely want to have the tech expertise in house that said getting outside help agency to build an mvp so you can further validate your idea and get customer feedback might not be a bad idea you want to implement the least amount of product you can get away with dont build your dreams build the bare minimum and see if it sticks this should bring the costs down and let you move quickly echoing other comments do not spend all your money on this you should probably keep the initial mvp cost down to at most half of your budget as a rough measure in parallel search for a cofounder showing how you handle the productmarketbiz side of things and seeing users reaction to your mbp will give potential cofounders confidence that you know what youre doing if you go with an agency see if you can get the mvp built as a fixed price and as breakdown per feature the agency will probably balk at this if the technical specification is not detailed enough this is great it means you havent been detailed enough so dive into those details and iron things out you will also see how much something will cost which will give you incentive to trim your dreams down for the mvp if you have a dev friend ask them to go with you through your spec and also periodically check in with the team to see the progress and raise any red flaga of they see it in any case you want to keep a close eye on the development try work in progress versions as theyre done to spot any inconsistencies  basically be more involved in the process throughout,30-12-2024 20:12,Jaspernalu,Reddit,General Discussion

yeah i got a story or two about this the problem is that selling is the aim of the game  that applies to both your product and yourself meaning the startup by selling yourself basically what i mean is kissing up to folks to make a good impression to potential customers investors etc the founders play a part in this  and the earlier you are the bigger that part is so in order to succeed in that world  selfassuredness is a valuable trait unfortunately that often bleeds over into just straight up arrogance delusion etc what im getting at here is that such behaviors correlate with certain personality types theres a level of asshole in many founding teams  not always and not always overt ive also seen this play out in companies with inexperienced young cofounders who go through programs like yc theyre told how fucking wonderful they are constantly even though many of them dont actually know anything about the real world that tends to feed the above i suspect ill get ratioed for saying that but i dont care  its the reality edit saw someone else suggest that uncoachable and rigid is also a common trait id add that both of those may be interpreted as narcissistic or at the least correlated ive experienced all 3,30-12-2024 15:30,edkang99,Reddit,General Discussion
many cofounders including those who wouldnt otherwise be considered narcissistic over estimate their value and their future performance they think the company will be wildly successful of course otherwise they wouldnt start it in the first place but this assumption of success is connected to what they think they are going to do to make it successful they are picturing themselves performing a levels above all others including their own past selves ive worked with these people before one of my cofounders thought he was so important that he wrote the operating agreement to cover his interests even at the expense of others so when others including me did more work than him he benefited disproportionately this is the problem with working with narcissists they think they deserve more than they do deserve and will take steps to cover their own butts at the expense of others i created a fix for this issue its called slicing pie and it helps determine a fair equity split that offers logical protection for all participants ,30-12-2024 15:30,edkang99,Reddit,Modeling and Development

for email outreach tools like gmass or mailshake are pretty affordable and let you automate followups while still keeping things personalized for linkedin and x phantombuster and zopto can help with automating connection requests and messages though youll still want to personalize key parts another hack is using apolloio or hunterio to quickly find and verify emails so youre not spending hours digging through profiles if scraping leads is the time sink instant data scraper a free chrome extension can pull data directly from linkedin or other websites which speeds up the process the key is balancing automation with personalizationautomate the repetitive stuff finding leads followups tracking and spend your time focusing on the parts that actually need your human touch its still a grind but these tools can save you hours without breaking the bank,30-12-2024 9:37,LifeguardHaunting999,Reddit,Modeling and Development
you are doing it right by not using the tools at this stage it is supposed to be exhausting if you are bootstrapping no ones heard about you trust you but the passion will show it will be really slow but cold emails do work if you have the right product just keep a realistic conversion rate in mind,30-12-2024 9:37,LifeguardHaunting999,Reddit,Modeling and Development
are you going to events related to your startup often networking is a huge time saver for linkedin versus just cold outreach meet as many people as you can give them your card and get their linked in and try to have a discussion with them they can remember and mention it in your linkedin follow up message i was ceo of an ai startup in 2018 i went to networking events non stop and just gobbled up every person in our demo i could connect to on linkedin luckily im very personable and charismatic and usually would end up getting sales meetings w them within 23 weeks conversion rate for scheduling a meeting was about 40 and sales were about 20 of those its how i got my biggest customer and eventually sold my startup good luck,30-12-2024 9:37,LifeguardHaunting999,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

first of all very good intention no need to do complex devops at this stage it might even make sense to think outside of aws hosting eg via vercel in my experience can be easier than via aws amplify and other specialised services might be similar and depending on what you write just using nextjs on vercel might actually cover frontend and backend for you in aws itself amplify for frontend hosting and lightsail for the backend could be the combination that is easiest,30-12-2024 9:16,AusEngineeringGuy,Reddit,Modeling and Development
for immurio im running the same stack as you i use amplify hosting for both the react frontend and the express backend its a bit of a struggle to get set up correctly in the beginning but pretty much smooth sailing after that i also use amplify for the nextjs marketing site remember amplify hosting is a different product than amplify pricing is also cheap enough and you can set caps and weekly reports using aws budgets,30-12-2024 9:16,AusEngineeringGuy,Reddit,Modeling and Development

i suggest vercel for your frontend and a cheap vps for your expressjs backend if you really want to try the services you mentioned apply for startup programs and use elastic beanstalk its easy to configure,30-12-2024 9:16,AusEngineeringGuy,Reddit,Products and Economics
dont ever say the sentence throw something at aws if that is your mindset youll be in deep trouble when building thankfully you appear to get it let people who know what they are doing cloud engineersarchitects take care of scaling issues and managing cost i would minimally throw it into an ec2 until you have traction if you expect to scale in the cloud you should be lurking the cloud architect groups aws and gcp groups and absorbing like a sponge or find their help,30-12-2024 9:16,AusEngineeringGuy,Reddit,Critical Thinking

what you need is to first identify where your ideas fall to dont be one of those people who try to do everything under the sun see if your idea falls into the following categories and try to find a group with like minded people 1 physical consumer products  i actually have a subreddit 2 saas  there are plenty of groups and discord channels 3 non for profit service models 4 other service base categories 5 ai deep learning 6 programming 7 fmcg most of the startups fall under the above categories  i might have missed a few but the gist is to first identify what you are interested in the category name or how it is identified is not so important because joining a group is not the hardest part  there are many trust me the hardest is to find an ideal group with like minded people im in a discord channel for physical consumer goods and a few of the above list  reason i surround myself with other disciplines is because im in innovation and i need to learn from different fields to educate myself it might be the same for you  in the field of mental health dont just isolate yourself with startups that work on mental health also find a a group of medical experts in the field of mind or psychology but dont go jumping into a startup group with electronic or hardware teams and expect similar experience find your ideal community,30-12-2024 7:00,yogi_rahul,Reddit,Modeling and Development

following is what ive gathered from personal experience as well as learning from experienced founders hope thats helpful your early product needs real users who love it not just quick growth heres how to get there talk to 30 potential customers first have coffee with them learn their problems see if your solution clicks these chats tell you more than any spreadsheet can know what makes you essential find the one thing that makes users stick around maybe its not your coolest feature  its how you fix their daily headache watch these signals  do users come back after trying you out  can they explain why youre useful  are they telling friends about you skip the fancy stuff early on  test ads with 100  record how people use your product  trade gift cards for feedback for technical founders trust what users tell you even if its not in numbers your first version wont be perfect  thats okay the best sign when customers become fans who bring you more customers start small make those few users happy then grow,30-12-2024 0:26,justiproof,Reddit,Modeling and Development

in the beginning its not about being paid  its about growth growth would be my number 1 kpi  how many new customers are we seeing daily then my second one would be how many are returning the next day adjust the duration for your product as for marketing you may not have a small enough target audience step back and really think about the one customer segment who is using your product  then test with them,30-12-2024 0:26,justiproof,Reddit,Modeling and Development
execution is about incrementally and progressively derisking your business theyre connected but its best to look at execution as totally separate from building the product at least initially with the exception of technical execution but thats not what were talking about gtm is about testing the market with various hypotheses about your clients problems where they congregate and how to reach them you might gtm multiple times gtm is about finding the initial group youre selling to and then you retool your marketing messaging until you have product market fit consistent scaleable growth is the byproduct of pmf though roi on different channels will diminish over time,30-12-2024 0:26,justiproof,Reddit,Modeling and Development

i can relate in some way it also resembles an observation from the video games industry games that are made by the developers because they simply want to create something that they are craving to play themselves become oftentimes alltime goodies and other games such as from big companies that are planned according to a manifold of best practices of effective managers are usually mediocre at best i face a similar issue at the moment my main expertise is cryptopology and most of the tools that i can wield are means of ensuring userbusiness privacy however last year trying validating my business ideas with these mechanisms i had to face plenty of discussions with possible customers about the actual value of privacy that it will provide to their business and what a possible roi is and at the same time trying to come up with possible market penetration forecasts after 4 months of fighting all these issues i decided to not care at all im convinced that this stuff is useful and i will simply continue building it not only due to my confidence but also because it is fun seeing for example a survey service working fully encrypted without anyone having means of decrypting individual answers,29-12-2024 21:00,GonzaloNediani,Reddit,Modeling and Development

you are approaching this from the wrong angle the idea is indeed almost worth nothing generally but its not meant to be ingenious it is meant to be worked out in much more detail you need to refine the idea first in your head many many times until all pieces start to make sense once you are at that level thats when you need to do market research and see if your idea has any value no big investments yet  just finding out learning about users testing hypotheses and so on once you have it validated and learned what was wrong and what was right about your idea nows the time to come up with a simple proof of concept and then validate again and only then are you ready to invest into building something,29-12-2024 18:48,IamUrWivesBF,Reddit,Modeling and Development

you might need to accept that you arent the right person to build every random idea you have our startup weve heard a few thousand business pitches total over the years we always ask what problem does this solve what do people do currently what unfair competitive advantage do you have how will you go get customers when does it break even then the secret hidden question who would be the right personteam to accomplish this you may be failing that last question plenty of people come up for amazing medical ideas but they have never worked in medicine or pharmaceuticals so they dont know their idea is legally ethically or financially infeasible one time i saw someone try to pitch a business because their work basically gave them infinite air miles and they wanted to try and figure out how to make that profitable on the side somehow a guy with no insurance or transportation experience was mad they didnt qualify for a discount so they wanted to exactly copy a program by a major car insurance carrier but you know do it better out of spite trying to use ai to make an ai solution is probably super common right now but if you dont have customers already why would they need you when they could just use existing ai the same way you are trying once a guy asked if he could hire us to write a crypto coin and then he wanted to pay us in that hypothetical coin i asked then why would i need you i get the feeling you are mostly focused on get rich quick but you can only be that self serving if you actually solve a problem better than the other options including doing nothing,29-12-2024 18:48,IamUrWivesBF,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

i can guarantee you that there were likely over one thousand people who came up with the general concept of uberor netflixor insert startup here it wasnt that any of these ideas were first but rather that those who really dove in were both connected to the right capital and had the skillset to execute ideas are almost practically worth nothing especially if you lack the technical skillset to execute on them so you need to focus your time on building skills to help you execute on ideas not on coming up with more and more ideas,29-12-2024 18:48,IamUrWivesBF,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

from a financial perspective its an awful deal 7 for 125k it really depends on how much you value the network they are valuing your company at 179 million so you have to ask yourself if you think the network is worth more than that to you filling out the app never hurts helps you get more clear with your idea so can always apply and then if you get in make that decision for yourself,29-12-2024 18:41,Alternative_Goose624,Reddit,General Discussion
the answer to your question will matter if you are selected so if its yes  ofcourse it is super helpful despite the criticism you hear it helps you enough that you wont worry about resources atleast for some time and focus on building the product and marketing the most beautiful part is networking once you get funded by yc even if you fail you have that network and experience which will help you to build another company it will be easier for you to start again once you get funded by investors raising money is not difficult for you because you know how to do it overall its worth getting into yc,29-12-2024 18:41,Alternative_Goose624,Reddit,Modeling and Development
honestly i would worry about it after you get in the probability of getting in is so low that spending any time thinking about it beyond the application is likely wasted the application has value as a thoughtreview exercise if you have done that work already and a forcing function if you havent done that work every startup has to do the work necessary to collect the information they require in the application whether the information is presented in their desired format is what is new getting into y combinator is super tough and unlikely without experience at the right companies bschools or startups keep in mind any experienced vc will tell you that the leadership team is the most important factor of any startup yc makes no apologies for demanding elite founders what constitutes elite is what changes from cohort to cohort since the vc world is in love with ai the ai focus is big right now again the probability is so low that id ask the is it worth it question only after you get accepted,29-12-2024 18:41,Alternative_Goose624,Reddit,Modeling and Development

i think its still a major advantage and worth it for most startups if you get in but that doesnt mean its actually good most yc founders i talk to said it didnt seem that helpful its just a testament to the state of vc industry that its so much harder to get funded without yc,29-12-2024 18:41,Alternative_Goose624,Reddit,General Discussion

what roles you trying to hire at first figure out if you need this and if yes exactly what roles do you need to hire id suggest to postpone expanding the team unless it is supported by revenue as labour cost could be the biggest expense category at early stages if you dont have a strong technical leader i suggest to stick with linkedin to find him nowadays every decent software engineer has to have a linkedin profile and if they dont they most likely are freelancers and wont have a relative experience so by looking at other services you have a smaller pool of candidates with this said you can try wellfoundcom  formerly angelslist as it was created for startups if you already have one a good strategy would be to pitch at your local uni students are cheaper to hire and sometimes they are even more motivated to work especially at startups but be careful and keep a healthy proportion of skilled development and students,29-12-2024 17:09,ResidentPale4214,Reddit,Critical Thinking

so already assuming u have the technical capabilities  i still am unclear on the benefits fundraising today is achieved today in various ways bonus can u name them and critique the ones your target customer urrently uses you want to be cheaper that assumes the fundraiser has an inescapable pain brought about through the 123510 that they are currently paying out of the current methods is this true likely not other parts of the value chain ie donors are likely more disincentivised to donate if a large proportion is wasted that is more a function of how efficient fundraiser is going to be with the remaining 9099 eg 33 might be overhead for their corp structure or some is lost to corruption in countries with dodgy governments for example you say you can be cheaper how the cost of transaction is essentially the errorfraud rate stripe have best and lowest fraud rates in the industry as a payment provider but they still charge comparably with mastercardvisa because its essentially a monopoly and there will also always be some fraud costs to mitigate platforms like gofundme are ontop of this and hence costs rise to 10 in principle a crypto platform could work but in practise what is requiredwhat is feasible im not following the space but to my knowledge no platform eg bitcoinethereumdoge has reduced endoftheday transaction and transfer costs to the users more than the loss leader of a simple bank transfer which is free and prevented volatility most stable coins suffered from volatility until a critical mass but to get into them how are you going to capture the value in the form of the original donations   it will be mastercardvisastripe which will have fees then if value is held in the stablecoin it could only reduce feescosts if the value is used as collateral to release real fiat funds or otherwise you expect to create a network of orgs that hold value in these stablecoins indefinitely which is ambitious,29-12-2024 16:19,No-Fisherman-8894,Reddit,Modeling and Development

a lot of info is missing typically i wouldnt say support teams want to work in slack tools like zendesk have a lot of features that slack would be missing so im questioning whether this solves a problem worth solving secondly regardless of the problem you have no marketing reddit is not the way it doesnt work you need to find out where your clients are and let them know what your doing also usually when talking to clients youre basically building a pipeline so what happened to those people if theyre not engaging that is a bad sign,29-12-2024 13:03,StevenJang_,Reddit,General Discussion

hey i see a lot of people criticizing your decision versus answering your questions and as a current founder  startup advisor  former compensation manager just going to toss out there on what to pay  there are resources for this there are free sources sometimes less quality because of the price point and paid ones some good paid ones radford mercer pequity  listed in order of price radford is 1015k mercer 710k pequity 5k if you dont want to buy generally csuites are paid in range of 200400k in tech for salary  the rest is equity and bonus equity usually in tech is a 4 year grant with 1 yr vest amount for csuite is usually up to 1 but you can always give more equity and its hard to take away so dont start at 1 if you can avoid it if these are just advisors not operators i usually give 01 over 2 years and up the grant amount for more work only employees or investors get more than 03 in my company now in the market salary and equity vary by role but really what varies is the criticality to your business and what you can afford so as a tech company for example a technical advisor is likely worth more to you however a business advisor in your exact space with customers lined up may be more critical you likely wont know which roles are most critical until you get moving so imo i would start all these roles on similar pay and tweak  give more overtime to those that deserve it not sure this helps  dm if you have questions,28-12-2024 19:22,mad-in-french,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

ive run a couple startups but havent had an outsized exit yet this sounds more like an advisory board than actual employees general legal guidance for advisory equity is generally in the 02505 range with a twoyear vesting term the reason why is that advisors often appear great on paper in the early days but as the business evolves and the needs change theyre often underutilized over a multiyear period that said in my most recent business one of my advisors whos also a mentor and provides actual help with the work occasionally alongside strategy guidance and i gave him to lawyers disapproval 3 of the business if the business was continuing on i would increase his equity to 5 so like most things its a judgement call but id start low and work into it,28-12-2024 19:22,mad-in-french,Reddit,Modeling and Development
some good advice in here ill chime in and say no matter the title experience or salary  design the first few hires you need based on the outcomes you want to create its likely but not impossible that if you were to hire csuite members that its too much oversight and advisory vs doing actual work there are csuite hires you could make which can play both roles for advice in this thread to be even more helpful you should describe why you think you need any hires edit even more than the original post most csuite members should bring their network with them and that can be a valuable asset but reality could be you need a head of sales with clear targets vs csuite members who you hope can leverage their network,28-12-2024 19:22,mad-in-french,Reddit,Critical Thinking

theres no silver bullet you have to try different things until you find messagechannel fit the only way to do that if youre starting from scratch is to test lots of ideas fast come up with hypotheses you can test run small marketing tests gather data discard what doesnt work and double down on what works you may have tried some initial approach that isnt working for some reason rather than stress about it iterate or try something else for example you tried ig reels for 30 days and got little traction you can iterate on that channel perhaps changing your message or targeting a slightly different profile and see if you find the right match also try something else maybe spend 500 on paid tiktok ads using a trending format see what happens keep running small marketing experiments until you find an outlier try partnering with yt creators in your niche try cold emails etc you get the idea be sure to focus on the right kpis obviously you have to prioritize and be smart about your budget but its well worth it in the beginning to try as many small experiments as you can and gather your own data rather than looking for one silver bullet that approach will give you greater roi over time if you want to make the process a bit easier shoot me a dm and i can send you my database of marketing experiments and growth ideas you can start testing in your niche right away i hope that helps good luck,28-12-2024 17:08,poeticjustice3355,Reddit,Modeling and Development

for scaling i would suggest talking to contract manufacturers usually smaller cms closer to your place of business first see how much cash you would need to scale up as far as ip ingress protection there are labs out there who can do testing and provide you with a certificate but you can also do a hacky way of testing initially to improve on your design when you reach volume it wouldnt be a bad idea to approach a reputable manufacturer in china to scale into the higher volume depending on the customer base and usage certifications can wary generally i would compare with a similar product in the market and see what certifications they are offering and try to match with them on the minimum,28-12-2024 8:59,huniluluu,Reddit,Modeling and Development
actually nobody has time to share what problems they are facing they are too busy with their own life  said one of my clients he used his alternative approach he started working in the industry like doing plain operational work being an outsider you have so much feedback about what sucks and what does work slowly he found one problem industry has no tool for analysis everyone was kind of working on pdf or converting pdf to excel and doing their own analysis what he did came up with his own idea and we built his idea from scratch and started presenting as a solution this helped him get paying customers for that mvp especially people who were too busy with excel sheets or had 0 knowledge about excel sheets and analytic we built his mvp in 7 ish days and started getting feedback on 9th day subsequently he built other tools around it in short if you can niche down an industry and start working either sales or marketing or operations you will find way more valuable ideas to work on being an outsider gives you an edge,28-12-2024 7:47,CreativeBasil5344,Reddit,Modeling and Development

raising money is a business transaction vcs back early founders based on the team but that doesnt mean you shouldnt have your ducks in a row you need a proforma financial plan for 510yrs you need market comps ltv cac tam etc you should figure out your marketing strategy  competitive differentiation and make sure they align they dont need to be exact or perfect but they need to be reasonable enough to project a npv return between 510x the initial investment valuation thats how you know how much money to raise and when then you shop that narrative and plan around until you find a vc who gets your story both financially and productwise there are plenty of templates to start with and chat gpt can help with the rest and if the number you want is 1 then what you really want is preseed that lowers the bar for financial planning but still good to have anyway since it solidifies your seriousness as a founder with angels you really shouldnt take anyones money unless you have a financial plan to provide a return worthy of the risk,28-12-2024 5:40,AbakarAnas,Reddit,General Discussion
youre way too early for seed which is 1m nowadays you need a preseed investment hit up friends and family and cold email entrepreneurs who you know will understand your product and your market you might also look at angel investors in your area dont waste time with accelerators and vcs right now probably best just not raise money at all at this point and look into moving in with family and getting your spend down to 0 many places give out credits like candy nowadays,28-12-2024 5:40,AbakarAnas,Reddit,Modeling and Development
its relatively hard to raise nowadays unless youve already had a successful exit already have a relationship with vc funds or have someone on the team thats very well connected not every founder is ex faang but it does help derisk the investment for a vc since they assume the tech team has at least some idea what theyre doing biggest concern i see is lots of free users but no paying customers its really easy to get someone to use a free service but vc will want to see evidence you can close sales and convert some to paying,28-12-2024 5:40,AbakarAnas,Reddit,General Discussion

i have gone through this at a much later stage at a substantial size through mediation and then litigation without getting into the details what you need to do is the following 1 spend the money to hire lawyer to review the operating agreements and founding documents and then have your lawyer send letter with the terms you want to happen 1 termination 2 anything that can be harmful to the business etc and then he will have to respond legally and that will cost  and he will most likely go away 2 founders can fire a founder at any time for cause,28-12-2024 2:53,Critical-Nature-4598,Reddit,Critical Thinking
just a small advise on the side typically if you need to escalate it is often a good idea to escalate in stages rather than go all in so take a moderate action see how she behaves if no cooperation take next escalation step and so on typically it is a good strategy to show goodwill first is there some winwin agreement possible for us all and only use means of force when all other means have failed because ideally you dont want either party to leave burned ground behind it also would not look too good in front of investors but of course you do not need to follow that if you have good reasons it might in some cases be better to radically make a cut if the situation eats up your attention and energy just note that the first approach is often the more elegant one,28-12-2024 2:53,Critical-Nature-4598,Reddit,Modeling and Development

the fact you currently have an operating business is going to help your case when searching for funds as for the cofounder part if the terms are agreeable then its not terrible idea make sure you have contracts written up prior to the agreement so there is something concrete to negotiate around you should take into consideration the freelancers abilities but more importantly their ability to run a business not just a solo venture and their appetite for sharing risk over all not a terrible idea but dont believe that its the only way to get funding,28-12-2024 1:01,ZanyGreyDaze,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

i dont think this will change in 2025 if you take a look at the yc companies for example there has been a shift into the direction of ai companies which is continuing with most of the solutions you can imagine at first glance this seems like a great opportunity to see the amount of possible customers rise but at the same time the amount of open source tools is also rising significantly nonaicompanies may not know this yet but in my daily life as a vc it seems like all of the ai companies are aware of this and use those tools for me it seems to be pretty unlikely that you can build better tools this is not meant to be offensive in any way than those open source tools and sell them to those ai companies on a daily basis in 2025 i would focus on selling ai to non ai companies  they are less aware of the amount of free opps ,27-12-2024 21:05,Highscorer27,Reddit,Modeling and Development

the chinese will copy your stuff so fast and start selling it for half it will make your head spin they are trolling you and this is espionage you should report this to the fbi maybe ask the fbi if they would like to be onsite to arrest chinese spies when they come for a factory tour  right now to stall them you can tell them you do sensitive work at your facility and need a list of any person interested in touring along with scans of their ids and that photos are not allowed in your facility for security reasons if they give you the list you can forward it along to the fbi getting a list and ids of anyone touring is very common for anyone producing military parts and only us citizens are allowed in certain areas of the tour seriously give these spies nothing they arent going to buy any products contact the fbi now,27-12-2024 16:46,oof_ope_yikes,Reddit,Modeling and Development
just say no if they were really a customer concerned about your product they would be focused on the result and if they were a competitor they would be focused on the process they didnt ask for a small order to sample with like a real customer doing due diligence would they put in a large order to trigger your greed and are insisting that if you show them how the sausage is made theyll pay you a bajillion dollars in orders if you are legitimately thinking that they may be legit for whatever reason then simply offer a sample for testing if theyre a real customer that wont be a show stopper if theyre a competitor then theyll be dramatic about canceling an order and then eventually theyll fuck off they heard of you through your great reputation but need to see the factory i bet you bought the car you drive in part on the manufacturers reputation and you never even considered a factory tour because it wouldnt tell you shit unless you were also a car manufacturer and understood the process,27-12-2024 16:46,oof_ope_yikes,Reddit,Modeling and Development

topic all about the humans for whom we propose to create value and the many ways in which we can increase our understanding and build up empathy for others too often we abstract people into icps and market segments theres a place for that but most of the time i sense that founders have skipped a lot of really rich and good stuff and gone straight to abstractions in an effort to shortcut the business creation process but its a mistake great entrepreneurs understand whats going on in the world and whats going on in other people  as individuals as well as societies  civilizations  ecosystems  a global economy there are great crossdisciplinary insights to be had by sprinkling in a healthy dose of human psychology human behavioral biology etc if you seek to create value for humans become a student of human nature,27-12-2024 14:09,edkang99,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

if that waitlist signup cta followed a clear communication pricing then youd have strong signals of validation and even viability in other words the visitor saw how much it might cost and was still persuaded by the value prop but if visitors signed up with no skin in the game best you could say is you have signals of interest and thats okay because these visitors have indicated a willingness to engage that still presents an opportunity to interview and learn more which is better than nothing you might even use the opportunity to figure out pricing ,27-12-2024 13:40,Fluffy-Guidance3399,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

i think this perception stems from a wrong idea how startups and startup ideas work generally speaking most startups are simply a recombination of existing components sometimes not even that just a copy of an existing idea in a new environment for example service x exists in india but not in europe for any reason so you introduce exactly the same service also in europe the key often lies in shaping and reshaping your idea and refine it initially it usually is just a rock so you need to polish it turn it around change it challenge it and so on until it slowly starts taking the shape of a diamond note 95 of ideas you probably need to discard at some stage during the refinement process a refined business idea impresses through elegancy it just looks logical once presented all pieces somehow fit together but there are many many pieces and details and some of them may make or break everything for example if you cannot determine who your customers are you know for sure your idea does not work out you absolutely need to have an idea who they are where they are when they are and how to approach them also it might make sense to start with filling out a business canvas you can easily google that but dont get immediately discouraged this is part of the refinement process treat it as a learning exercise not as a question of success or failure you have an idea about the world and you want to learn if what you believe about the world is actually right the remaining 5 of ideas are the ones which  after lots of refinement  you need to verify its like science you have a hypothesis your business model working but you dont know for sure so next step is  before building anything  you try to approach potential customers and learn from them do a questionnaire talk to them send them a message on linkedin give them a phone call whatever just make sure you start gathering their feedback to verify your hypothesis youll notice that you got maybe 50 right and 50 wrong with those insights try to establish a first and very cheap proofofconcept maybe just a wireframe some drawings maybe a figma prototype whatever you need to  again  go back to customers and validate your idea observe how they interact with your idea learn from them if still convinced youre onto something nows the time to build a minimal viable product keep it cheap dont overspend always treat it like an unverified idea you are still not sure whether you are onto something until you have paying customers there is a big danger of overspending either time or money for nothing so you want to learn quickly fail cheaply if you fail and get feedback quickly from customers on every idea you have to extend your product if youre onto something you should get some positive signals dont ever believe in promises to buy the only two currencies worth anything is people actually buying or at least spending time with your product everything else is just empty hope then grow your product as you can see this is not so much about having the one single ingenuous idea its much more about having an initial goodenough idea and then do lots of rounds to refine it learn from customers learn learn learn many iterations failing many times but each time learning more and the strange thing is you can beat a company like google with this approach why because they are like huge ships death star whereas you are like an agile miniboat xwing they are extremely slow and bureaucratic remember they have slack and need to maintain a huge workforce and a very big reputation to lose whereas you have almost nothing to maintain or lose in the early stages so instead of stating there are no startup ideas you could treat this as a problem others might have too ask yourself it looks to me its a problem finding a startup idea maybe finding a startup is actually a startup idea because if you have that problem others have it too then you have to reframe that and refine it what does that mean there are no startup ideas for sure there exist startups how do these people find their ideas if they can and you cannot what is the difference between them and you this is now a learning opportunity apparently they know something you dont know what is that something try to find that out no need to buy anything or build any code just think how could i find out what they know and i dont well one idea could be to go to reddit and ask the question maybe someone writes something helpful maybe nobody does another idea is to actually send them an email inquiring about your question asking whether they would be willing to have a chat with you just a bit of their time youre trying to learn something see how they react are they defensive or maybe they want money for talking to you or maybe they hope they get a nice customer by talking to you try to find that out and so on,27-12-2024 12:26,candle_misuser,Reddit,Modeling and Development

im an engineer and my nontech cofounder offered me a 5149 split after a year of building and a few pivots we started getting interest from some big wellknown companies but then she started saying i give off individual contributor vibes and that the original 5149 split was unfairit should be more like 7030 she also wanted me to take on an extra role we havent signed any contracts theres no real revenue yet and ive been the one funding the startup i decided to cut my losses and walk away dont waste your time with someone like this but honestly finding a different cofounder might still be worth it for you,27-12-2024 7:14,Icyphox,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
just test if he can walk the walk write a contract that has conditional vesting on both sides you do your role and he does his role if he is able to do what he says eg raise a couple mil on nothing but a concept great if not then ur better off doing ur own thing easier to learn how to sell than how to build a product if hes good he shouldnt have a problem with it,27-12-2024 7:14,Icyphox,Reddit,Company and Services

practically hes recruiting you into his business and i wouldnt be surprised if there is a plan for how your share vs his will shrink if pushed itll just sound like a normal explanation describing normal developments work put in shares instead of salaries where his role obviously should have a greater salary and so on and he might be right about all of that you cant both be equal solo founders at the top and you shouldnt walk into this thinking that youll be if hes got a business in place with a team itll be very hard for solo you to be anything but a recruitment no matter what the actual agreement sounds like and if you try to fight that itll hurt the business as well as your future in it,27-12-2024 7:14,Icyphox,Reddit,General Discussion

conventional wisdom from yc et al is that you need a cofounder because 1 it derisks their investment if anything happens to you 2 its unlikely that youre exceptional enough to be great at everything so makes it more likely that the founding team is great at everything from tech to sales 3 it doubles or triples the amount of free work early on 4 creates an environment where ideas can be challenged 5 reduces chance of burnout finally its also just more fun if you find the right cofounder there are obviously drawbacks to cofounders risk of breakup etc but on balance the vcs think cofounders are better so founders buy into that because they want to raise money i say all this as a solo founder who has worked with a cofounder twice and broken up for various reasons but i think when it works it really works the problem is that you need it to happen organically its very difficult to force finding a cofounder,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,General Discussion

i think burnout is a big factor with three cofounders ive found that at least one of us is often dealing with normal life struggles which can make them feel mia at times when that happens one of the other founders usually picks up the slack its like a basketball gamesometimes one founder is the mvp pushing things forward but when they get bogged down with life or work another steps in and carries the team that kind of rotation helps us keep moving forward but it also highlights the reality that no one can be on all the time i think savvy investors understand this cycle and know the risks of having just one person juggling everything its one thing to hire someone for a job but its entirely different when you have founders whove put their own time energy and money into building something that level of investment adds a deeper commitmentyoure not just clocking in and out youre personally tied to the success or failure of the company its a balancing act but its also what makes startups resilient when one of us struggles we know the others will step in and that trust in each other is what keeps us going,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Modeling and Development
 however why are even technical founders trying so hard to find a cofounder this seems to imply the technical part is the hard part as a technical cofounder i think the business part is the hard part for example its looking like my cofounder will land a b2b contract with a demo i made in 4 days i dont think i could ever sale that well,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Modeling and Development
oh i have been in this situation and can explain i was the technical cofounder i could build anything and i was freelancing a couple of clients sold what i built for them for millions and of course i only got paid what i charged zero equity none of the millions made it back to me so clearly i could build milliondollar code but you know what i couldnt do  find a proper business idea  deal with the paperwork involved in running a company adhd fml  talk to clients promote the company all the peoplerelated stuff i work best alone in a dark room away from other humans  marketing and sales   im a builder thats what im good and and what i enjoy doing every other part of owning or growing a business i suck at it because its all so boring and uninteresting i tend to build and lose interest once its built promoting and maintaining a d growing and optimizing is boring so i looked for a cofounder who would be good at all of that stuff i interviewed nearly a hundred potential cofounders listening to their business idea and their experience until i found a good match promising business idea a dude with relevant experience and the skills to raise money and grow the business and that was the best decision of my life sure our first startup failed but we still raised a few millions and did our best for 6 years then my cofounder had another better idea to solve one of our main issues so we closed down that 1st gaming startup gave the little money left back to pissed investors and started a brand new company in fintech this time its been 5 years now we make nearly half a million in sale per day growing exponentially 50 employees and acquisition offers coming regularly at values that would make me and the next 3 generations filthy rich alone i wouldnt have been able to grow something like that i wouldnt have had the idea i wouldnt have been able to raise 40 millions that have been needed to survive and pay the bills i wouldnt have been able to bullshit our first clients into signing i wouldnt have been able to grow the business i just wrote code and sure i only have about 7 ownership of the company left every round it gets lower but 7 of a multimillion dollar company is much better than 100 of a worthless company,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Work and Collaboration

for me the reason for finding a cofounder was simple its more fun to build with other people its exciting to share a common goal and work with someone who shares the same excitement about an idea as you do,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Human Interaction
lots and lots of people cannot or will not think for themselves most people who do not need a cofounder and still seek one fall in that bucket 1 however a lot more people need cofounders than you might think such as people who need emotional support eg dont have a wife great friends etc or people who need to convince investors and cant otherwise  albeit many people can if they try and are capable or people who refuse to learn things and get their hands dirty  you would be shocked at the number of developers who consider themselves backend and will not touch frontend with a 20foot pole same with dealing with customers or talking to people etc these people should also probably not be starting a startup in the first place also if you do not need a cofounder but happen to have a great one thats also a great place to be  youre not going to toss them aside just because you could technically pull it off alone maybe in that case whether you need one or not is a bit of a moot point its highly unlikely youll end up in this scenario while looking around for a cofounder though 1 these people are doomed to fail for obvious reasons,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Modeling and Development
why are people so obsessed thats overstating it a bit i can understand why someone would want a technical cofounder someone who actually develops the product for free i dont think you do understand they dont develop the product for free however why are even technical founders trying so hard to find a cofounder because successful businesses require more than just a technical product many times they are looking for business cofounders who will take like 50 of the company yes cofounders take equity in exchange for a contribution in time skills and experience if you need extra help but cant afford why not just hire freelancers freelancers are not free good ones are not cheap none are invested in the success of your business i noticed that a lot of people who are seeking a cofounder dont even really need one cant say thats a phenomenon ive observed though i think youve decided they dont need one and therefore assume lots of people are looking for something they dont need they just want one just because why is that see above they have reasons they do need one am i missing something yes,27-12-2024 6:23,luke23571113,Reddit,Modeling and Development

if you can bootstrap id recommend doing it id only take money if i had to its good pr for a company when it raises money and acceptable to shout about so we often hear about the minority of companies that raise and not the quiet successful companies the first few million you make is life changing the path to that life changing money is much easier bootstrapping or taking a small angel round than vc money you dont need to build to a billion to give you a bit of context my first business took low 6 figures in funding off angels and i took it to 7 figures in revenue still growing close to 100 a year and profitable i own almost 70 of the business my competitor has raised over 30m where investors have preference shares they lose twice as much as they make in revenue they arent much bigger than we are and are growing at 25 a year the founders have less than 20 share of the business if they sell for 30m the founders get nothing because of the preference shares they are stupid financially undisciplined throw money at everything because they have so much of it and have to sell for over 30m to make a penny we are financially disciplined profitable grow without throwing money at things and im personally on track for an exit that pays me 8 figures vc is right for the minority of founders,27-12-2024 6:05,Aware_Pomelo_8778,Reddit,Work and Collaboration

as a technical solofounder a lot of these points are valid self reflection as well particularly in relation to build product vs sell product,26-12-2024 13:37,micupa,Reddit,Modeling and Development
yeah i got burned on 4 in a previous startup when i asked about social media posts newsletters etc his push back was always we dont have anything to write about which never rubbed me the right way eventually when the product was released he wrote a few posts here and there and then nothing it turns out he just wasnt good at that sort of thing but wouldnt admit it the problem was when i asked him to possibly give up some equity so we could bring on someone who loves this sort of thing he freaked out it was tricky because he had solid connections and made some non trivial contributions but there was a massive gap in customer acquisition,26-12-2024 13:37,micupa,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

i would add  1 there is no formal contract  contracts are there to protect you both not having one leaves expectations open to interpretation and often screws over the nonbusiness person  2 bloated titles  this can be fairly benign but also indicates that they dont understand the realities of a startup in which outcomes matter more than titles if they expect cofounder work and commitment but offer any other title then you are probably just the tech person in their mind,26-12-2024 13:37,micupa,Reddit,Modeling and Development

nah i met my business peeps in real life thru friends of friends and attending a lot of events my first couple years of startup life  13 years ago i went to about 6 events a week in my metro just trying to meet everyone here after about a year i met about 600 people for a get coffee or a beer level of conversations although lately i have had a few dozen people from reddit come find me on linkedin generally they say they liked a post and wanted to connect some of them seem pretty real national level experts on different stuff to be fair tho i get probably about 10 inbound connect requests a day and most of those are some kind of service provider still sometimes vendors become your friends or competitors come work for you i wouldnt rule out meeting someone on reddit to be a cofounder just because of where you meet them id say the bigger problem is people in the wild that are desperately seeking arent bound to save each other since they are both bound to have a meager amount of skillscasheffort to bring to the pot luck it can be the blind leading the blind in corporate gigs it can be really effective to make peers into friends when you are new and build alliances so you can tagteam pulling each other up the ladder when one of your gang gets a leg up the same strategy doesnt work in startups because there is no ladder someone else isnt desperate to get one of you all to take on new responsibilities so you cant wait on someone is bound to get promoted eventually rather its like you are loading up a boat with provisions on an exploration mission you dont know how far it is what resources you will find if you can conquer that hill or if its worth it at all in that case your best bet is not to wade into the shallows and look for other people in row boats and see if you guys can take turns rowing rather you may do much better paying attention to the captains returning in victory buying up into the next larger voyage and see if they need able workers and you learn from an experienced captain for a couple years before you set out in your own boat so many people are eager to make a name for themselves they are too proud to take a couple years of learning the vocation from a veteran,26-12-2024 13:32,edkang99,Reddit,General Discussion

i would use and pay for such a service im working on a cleantech startup that should qualify for some environmental grants and other incentives the federal grantsgov searching website is horribly outdated and returns totally unrelated searches to key words plus there are individual state city county district grants that also require their own time intensive searches and grant submissions and there are other grants available from universities and nonprofits theres something like 40000 nonprofits in the us alone plus there are corporations and industry associations that are seeking partnerships with startups too the grant searching and writing along with other incentives like tax rebates and zero interest loans would be a full time job at my company which i currently cant afford while bootstrapping as far as how you monetize it id recommend taking a 5 commission from every grant you win for your clients thats fair because it saves me a salaried position and it rewards you for continually improving your service thatd likely make you more revenue than charging xmonth for you which i could probably afford but thats a price point i wouldnt expect much from either whereas a commission percentage is a win win for both you and your clients while youre at it also alert your clients of networking events put onattended by those offering grantsincentives because its one thing to submit the grant paperwork and it is another to go meet the people approving them in person a service like this that alerts and automatically applies as new grants and incentives become available is a service i would use in perpetuity if youre actively developing this product then dm me your twitter or bluesky so i can track your progress id even be willing to be a beta tester for you thatd give you regular actionable feedback on your service,26-12-2024 12:54,Cliznitch,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

obviously some people are masters of the pump and dump where they hype vapourware setting that aside run a business as if you want it to make you a solid stream of money once it is doing this you have two choices mostly mutually exclusive you can grow the stream of money or you can refactor it so that it doesnt need your day to day input either way the company is now closer to having a fairly concrete value also you might just want to keep running it as that is just cool i find most entrepreneurs who burn out are the ones where the revenue isnt all that solid nor are they close to handing it over to someone else to run it day to day they are running around putting out endless fires fretting about cashflow and trying to recover or replace endlessly lost clients or worse striving for a mystical day where they stop losing money basically anyone talking about runway is in a bad place from a valuation point of view ive met people who have happily stepped back and say things like we have 2000 clients most of whom have signed 2year contracts have a 92 renewal rate and are adding 55 clients a month with a sales force of 10 people whereas when i hear someone say we have 3 fortune 500 clients and are working hard on a 4th i know they are probably doomed guess which one will get the higher value even if they are both bringing in the same revenue and have the same profits if you do sell make sure you get cash the only stock that a small company should ever take in a buyout is large cap publically listed companies nearly 100 of people i know who took stock from anything else got either a tiny fraction of the value they should or zero a weird one that i have heard a number of times was always the same two numbers i would guess our company was worth around 10m at the time we were given 20m in shares by scum inc by the time our shares vested they were worthless if you have a profitable company and take anything but cash or something as solid as cash then you are a fool,26-12-2024 5:58,psonic007,Reddit,Modeling and Development

what the next wave will be is the trillion dollar question some thought it was as going to be cryptoweb3 and while some people have gotten rich off of it it hasnt materially affected humanity like the dot com and smartphoneapp waves some think the next waves are robotics quantum computing self driving cars environmentcleantech humanmachine neural implant interfaces and vrar they will probably be right eventually but thus far theyve been huge holes that investors and corporations have thrown money into without much if any return which brings us to aiit is still in its early phases but it is improving rapidly and since ai can be used to improve itself its going to mature from its current adolescent stage of walking to making the fastest humans look slow very quicklywithin 5 years most likely and not longer than 10 years it is probable that the current fragmented scene of ai for every industry niche will eventually implode and the remaining few ais will end up dominating as they will do most everything users could want to do pretty well so what follows ai if i were to guess the next wave will be figuring out how to employ the millions of people that the near future ai and robotics will put out of work what can people uniquely do that ai and ai controlled robots wont ever be able to do well i dont know if youd asked me 5 years ago id have said creative work like art and graphic design would be safe from ai i had incorrectly assumed more rule based work like accounting and legal work would be the first to be made obsolete by ai and that has obviously not been the case so far at any rate good luck in figuring it out i dont envy your generation my advice is to work on whatever youre passionate about because money is a crappy barometer of real success,25-12-2024 20:57,airjoee,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

make sure you purchase your stock options so that you physically own those shares 99 of the time when you leave a company you must officially do this within a short timeframe of your departure defined within your option agreement usually 90 days sometimes 30 days or those options evaporate obviously if you know the particulars like total shares outstanding any liquidation standing preference stack from prior funding rounds most recent valuation and business metrics cash arr growth  comp multiples relative to arr prior funding and valuation  that should help guide whether the spend is worth it or if you chalk up as learning experience startup masters degree,24-12-2024 18:59,Melvin393,Reddit,Critical Thinking
advice that i was given long ago in the valley was if youre going to leave a company sell everything that you own in it because it means that you dont believe in it if you leave them and buy your shares you are definitely not able to have any control over how your money is dealt with and they will find a way to screw you in fact i have seen this happen to people many times they quit and then buy their shares the company continues to do what it does and quickly dilutes existing shares but issues more shares to keep current employees whole in incentivized value people who quit and bought their shares just end up with less money if you believe in the product try to find a way to stick it out even with them being clowns ive worked for a lot of clowns who still end up getting things across the finish line my recommendation is to talk with a therapist once a week or every two weeks so that you can maintain some mental fortitude in the midst of all of the drama heck the therapy might actually help you to find ways to perceive your colleagues differently or at least handle them differently,24-12-2024 18:59,Melvin393,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

ai is a tool there is a use case for any tool out there physical or digital ai has a lot of use cases explainable ai expands those use cases for ai i think it will definitely be a tool of growing importance but not a necessity it also depends on so many different things its hard to say that a blanket statement like this will always be true i think the use of ai for decision making can be a bad thing for decision makers in the long run similar to how college students use ai to do homework cheat pass the class or whatever  there comes a point where your only tool is a hammer because you never learned the other tools and every problem is a nail in my opinion there will always be cases where human thinking is a better tool than an ai model but this doesnt mean that ai wont be an extremely useful tool  sometimes just recognizing that a particular tool is the best for the job is the hardest part,24-12-2024 13:06,Lonely_Ad_8463,Reddit,Modeling and Development

very broad question so hard to answer i think theres a lot of variability in answers for these questions im for now assuming that you dont talk about vc investments from my own experience and what ive seen the timing has a lot to do with you personally ive seen many times that founders sell because they hate dealing with employees for example or there might be be an opportunity coming up and founders decide to go for it often i see founders prepare for it by taking more of a back seat in the time leading up to it so theres your answer on how to tell staff as far as leads go  it can be a broker but also i think often it makes sense to be acquired maybe there is a supplier that you work together with well the time leading up to the acquisition the two companies become more and more entangled already its just the logical path,24-12-2024 9:45,Alternative_Goose624,Reddit,Modeling and Development

former lawyer who went to work in vc here heres my 2 cents 1 equity ownership and vesting like everyone else here is saying make sure youre getting proportionate share of value from this venture you mentioned that your equity is vesting in 18 months but is this in clear writing everything in black and white you cant imagine how many cofounders ive seen screw each other over this when the startup really takes off 2 exit plan buyout options valuation methods and how shares will be distributed if you or the other cofounder wants out you cant take for granted that how things are now will continue longterm into the future also consider the terms of what happens if you quit before or after the vesting cliff 3 intellectual property define who owns the intellectual property created during your partnership this should be the startup as a business entity not any individual founder huge red flag to vcs is when the ip is held by one of the cofounders rather than the startup itself 4 noncompete and confidentiality lets say your cofounder decides to leave and you take over things you need to make sure the party leaving doesnt compete with the startup by simply redoing what youve worked on but for another venture 5 dispute resolution clauses save yourself a lot of time and money in the long run by having this outlined at the very start this helps especially if your cofounder has significantly more capital to screw you over in court arbitration and mediation are much cheaper alternatives that you can enforce with the right clause beforehand tldr protect yourself as early as you can this may seem like a small project now but huge problems can arise if it really takes off and disagreements occur my advice would be to get a startupvc specialist lawyer to look through your agreement right now and help you draft terms for your benefit while doing a contractual review of the terms proposed by the cofounder lawyers are expensive but the expense now will save you a lot of trouble in future,24-12-2024 3:29,gusyounis,Reddit,Critical Thinking

tons of reasons that this legislation was shot down  easy for large businesses to comply or absorb the fines while small businesses now have to pay for additional help to comply or take time from their valuable schedules  if you touch a bank account you already have to complete kyc including some degree of ownership information  the government already knows your revenue and income because you are required to report it and pay taxes on it  this is on top of the compliance required from the state social security pay roll taxes state income taxes and more so glad this disappeared and i saved thousands in compliance costs and hours of my life,23-12-2024 23:46,WAp0w,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

theres not a lot of information here to make the answer specific to your startup but mainly 2 things  speed as a small startup you actually have a huge advantage in the rate at which you iterate and develop as compared to a larger incumbent you arent tied down to internal bureacracy and can literally go to your early customers onsite to install and observe how they use your solution making you much more nimble  specificity the incumbet is likely diversified across various fronts on the industry whereas you are addressing a very specific problem with a very specific solution for that niche market theres no reason why your solution shouldnt be far superior to the incumbents being able to be hyperfocused on your much more specific customer segment means you have an edge to create a better product for them you cant compete on scale and credibility when compared against the established players and brands instead your advantage lies in zooming in on a very niche subsegment of the market and being able to iterate and improve faster than anyone,23-12-2024 19:51,Fine4FenderFriend,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

one of the largest issue we encountered in my last company had to do with wifi chipsets the 1000 pound gorilla in that market is qualcomm who owns the atheros chipsets the issue surrounds a particular mode that needs to be activated during certification testing for fcc approval by an independent test lab this mode required special software only available by a direct relationship with the manufacturer also this manufacturer didnt sell their chips through regular electronics distribution channels so without a very expensive licencing arrangement with the chipset manufacturer smaller companies were unable to design these chips into any of their products instead they were forced to buy module components from a limited selection of larger companies that had paid the exorbitant licencing fees this essentially locked out any company that was going to manufacture less than millions of units it is their option how they want to sell their chips since they are a large company it may just be they dont want to be bothered with smaller companies the chips i use now have this mode immediately accessible to our developers and i can buy them through standard distribution and sometimes small companies become large companies,23-12-2024 15:01,ElectronicLife3047,Reddit,Work and Collaboration

usually you do it backwards to what youre describing you should be seeing if there is a market and customers before you start building ideally you could get your first initial customers this way good resources to learn about this are steve blanks four steps to epiphany eric ries lean startup and rob fitzpatricks the mom test the latter two are easier reads and arguably all you need basically tells you the method on how to validate your idea and how to talk to customers then once youve got some confirmation or signal that there is a problem that your solution is solving then you build an mvp then from your first phase you should have a decent idea of who has the problem youre solving you get people to use the mvp and iterate based on feedback it depends on where you are in the world but incorporating a business is usually necessary when youre selling but you dont need to do that while youre just talking to people,23-12-2024 11:05,candle_misuser,Reddit,Modeling and Development

with a bit of background in launching mvp and helping startups scale i think we can shed some light on the matter first of all the idea stage needs to be validated before you even start the fancy engineering if you already have a list of prospects interested in your solution you have a reason to build it if not then its not worth moving forward  a lot of people will create simple web pages and start promoting them creating a list of emails prospects and conducting market research etc second of all you have a list of people interested in the solution you want to create you somehow already validated the market through market research and you have collected a few emails create an mvp  minimum viable product  it is a very small functional prototype that will give you a base start on earning some feedback or revenue from the market third of all reiterate relaunch and grow the future is straightforward get feedback from the small pool of clients make the product better and get feedback again  the cycle is formed the key note here the product may be 3040 of what matters what really does the trick is how well you can market and sell it we already saw great products making barely enough and bad ones going viral,23-12-2024 11:05,candle_misuser,Reddit,Modeling and Development

paying customers is one form of validation everyone saying paying customers is the definitive answer is wrong many startups exit without customers or sufficient revenue to be viable the primary answer is value established in the market and then you might ask well who determines value or isnt value subjective then youd actually be on the right track yes that if im an investor who understands what youre doing and agrees i might have my concerns overcome by you attracting the right team validation same token some other investor might say you need customers because thats what they believe and the reason customer alone is the absolute wrong answer is because maybe i want the and a team capable of something loosely related follow you created value with your startup of course that doesnt have to be established by investors marketers determine what it is in the market customers might value different things that youre doing engineers might value open source free innovation that has no customers people parrot customers because its so frequently said it isnt correct its the dumbed down answer primarily investors and advisors who dont know what theyre doing will tell you to focus on customers because it sounds like good advice when its actually a soft no,23-12-2024 0:18,kani_jn,Reddit,Critical Thinking

validation in business is different from validation in mental health therapy in therapy a patient can share a story about a bad situation that happened in their childhood and the therapist can act as a neutral third party to tell the patient wow that is fucked up  im sorry you werent protected and the client feels emotional relief from having shared a deep painful and private experience with someone with professional training and personality to be a good listener in a way that feels emotionally supportive and confirms the patient was correct to feel hurt and upset by that experience that is how therapy can confirm or validate the righteousness of their patient when they have been victimized in business validation is not a feeling we do not mean the emotional sensation of having a kind supportive person agree with you instead we mean paying customers like this product or service enough that this company could plausibly self supporting in a reasonable amount of time so business validation could be something like i put up fliers for my dog walking business and 20 people contacted me they live within a mile of my home if i charge each person 100 per week that business could pull in 2000 per week this should be part time work but full time pay i will make an llc and get quicken plus i should find some backup workers in case i need to take a sick day or for a more complicated business social media marketing has gotten sufficiently complex i think the consulting business could be focused down into a system that would work for 80 of small businesses now i just need to see if small businesses would pay for a social media strategy in a box solution i think it would bring 1000 a month in value to each customer but only cost me 50 a month to service once its built building the solution will cost 250000  what would it take for me to build this and get 300 customers once i get 10 consulting customers i will set aside money to start building automation with these 3 features and make sure people will pay me before i build out the rest,23-12-2024 0:18,kani_jn,Reddit,Modeling and Development
a lot of folks here are saying wait for paying customers thats like saying just wait till youre successful paying customers is the ultimate validation but in your current context its not really helpful is it whenever i work on a new idea to gain confidence i look at the problem or demand in forums subreddits or slack this helps me and whoever i am working with move forward with certainty so what youre essentially doing is validating the problem instead of the solution its better than using something like the mom test because its faster and you can find people who are in market for something new because the old way just isnt working anymore if youre interested ive written about this method in detail theres three parts to it i think this one might be the most helpful starting point,23-12-2024 0:18,kani_jn,Reddit,Modeling and Development

insurance companies make a relatively small portion of their revenue from insurance theyre pretty good at underwriting and risk analysis so that alone could be a business where 1 they make money and 2 dont fuck people over insurance companies make most of their money from investments and the amount of regulation around how much they need liquid to cover operating an insurance company versus tying up in investments is pretty sparse relative to how important the subject is so theyre incentivized in the name of jack welshs shareholder value and friedmans but its within the rules style of economics to have more cash on hand deny claims reduce service reverse auction for vendors etc to make investments not provide healthcare,22-12-2024 23:29,extracredick,Reddit,Work and Collaboration

lets say a family of 4 tried this they pay a total of 2000 a month into this fund after a year they would have 24k all well and good the problem is that if you need quite a series medical intervention you need 200k plus which would have taken 10 years of placing in the fund you clearly need more people to make the system work lets include the extended family for a total of 20 people 20 x 500 x 12  120k a year this is still not enough you need more people invloved to make this work but now you need people to manage all the payments incomining and claims the people putting money need to agree what level of care is covered like for example your aunt buying yoga pants and making a claim from the fund someone needs to tell her no also its sounding a lot like an insurance company now all developed countries except usa have the government manage this by collect premium through taxes and pay claims through free hospitals the huge scale makes the system cost effective even though people go for unnecessary care the problem with the private route is that greed ruins it as they deny claims for profit,22-12-2024 23:29,extracredick,Reddit,General Discussion

in trouble they start shipping lots of new features to expand horizontallyverticallygeographically before theyre even successful in their primary function it shows traction has plateaued theyve run out of ideas and are now trying to figure out what to do next a big indicator that a startup wont be a success though is the founders ability to intuitively understand data and translate that into strategy lots of people will say data is important but seemingly few will allow the business the time early on to invest in high quality granular reliable data even when they have that data some founders will be able to take a high level look get comfortable with assumptions and immediately see a way forward others will umm and ahh about whether we can trust it and then say so whats your point this latter group will only get so far the former group then just need a bit of luck to be genuinely successful,22-12-2024 23:24,tiggerclaw,Reddit,Modeling and Development

please do a quick google search i wont apologise for being blunt this is a poorly thoughtout question and theres no such thing as an ethical health insurance company you sound like someone whos just beginning to grasp how problematic the insurance industry not just healthcare is in the us and is exploring ways to mint by pitching an idea to vcs in an area you clearly lack expertise in even if i give you the benefit of the doubt heres my advice to understand how insurance premiums are calculated you need to dive into actuarial science and quantitative analysis the insurance industry is highly complex and typically draws players with substantial financial resourcesmost vcs steer clear of it for a reason if youre serious about exploring this start by researching which top vcs have been investing in this space and go from there,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Critical Thinking
honestly the insurance market is practically begging for disruption but the barrier to entry is impossibly high and is not capital efficient understatement compared to similar investments its not just insurance companies that are problematic but its the entire health care system hospitals and doctors upcharging insurance companies is one example if you pay cashdirect you can usually negotiate upwards of a 30 discount im generally for free markets but privatized healthcare in the us is nontenable edit  what i mean by capital efficient is that as an investor i have many more and much better options where i would invest for a return,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Energy and Problem Solving

the most ethical they currently get are nonprofit health insurance companies they are out there and some are very large blue shield of california being one of the largest even they have challenges with cost of healthcare etc the biggest difference is they are not motivated by share price so more dollars go into providing care and they have to keep their admin expense low they still have highly compensated executives though just not obscenely compensated like for profit,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
i know this is a startup discussion and it is not my intention to turn this into a discussion about health care but another thing to consider and a contributing factor in this whole quagmire is the social idea that health insurance is no cost medical coverage if an employer pays for medical insurance the employee tends to utilize that as their medical concierge want to lose a few pounds got to the doc and get prescribed wegovy and expect that its all free to the consumer the entitlement to all that health care has to offer at no cost is at an all time high somewhere along the way people have lost the concept that insurance is supposed to help in catastrophic situations not a solution for everything,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
every dollar of profit the company makes is one less dollar that goes to actual medical care the problem is hospitals have their own huge nonmedical overhead that makes healthcare expensive the only way to fix the issue is to cut as much of the middle man between doctor and patient ideally doctors goes back to being the business owner unfortunately everyone in power politically doesnt like this idea both party in the us theres a few ideas that exists which you can look into health share plans concierge medicine association plans definitely worth exploring now the important question is how much do you want to get paid doing this,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Work and Collaboration
have a look at what mark cuban is doing for his companies he likes to describe it as single payer but hes the one paying if theres a way to facilitate that for more companies without his resources maybe but yeah as others have said step one is probably have a billion dollars,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Modeling and Development
health care insurance is more or less healthcare cost financial management company you would take the estimated cost of medical care of your cohort of clients and then add 10 your office admin staff and some profit to that cost and break it into monthly payments thats the basics of the business the issue comes when the cancer treatment is 730000 a year because it has to pay for the a teams of skilled doctors and nurses and each area getting paid 140000430000 salary this might be good when you just need to buy pills and drugs at are 1 to make but when your client need skilled medical workers such as for surgery or mental health you are just paying the medical professionals hourly rate for a company it might seem unfair to pay 730000 a year to extend an 80 year olds life by 3 years but thats literally why they pay for health insurance i think you are hoping for some lowhanging fruit along the lines of this drug is only 3 per pill but the industry is charging you 24 its more that there are 57 year old who pays 450 premium a year but needs a 400000 treatment because thats how much cancer doctors cost to extend his life possibly for another 5 years thats where the whole health care system breaks down if you are dying you would pay everything you have and do everything possible to live longer vaccines for 7 that extend average lifespan by 3 years easy pass 6 month treatment than surgery costing 350000 over the whole course of the program including physical therapy recovery for a possibly 2 year extension in lifespan that question is someone no one else wants to answer you can literally pay college for a bunch of kids and change their lives forever tldr cost of health insurance is high because its expensive to hire medical professionals,22-12-2024 20:01,Snooopineapple,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

well it always comes down to what you think is success i started my journey 3 years ago to redefine what a pc case can be and build a brand around it and wanted to build more products over time i worked full time on it since start when i started i had 0 education 0 experience in the field no co founder and did almost knew nothing of running a company or start up its been one very difficult and lonely journey for me i put all energy and money into it it was something i believed in and wanted to do today i have a design patent been accepted into a an incubator got verification from a government run department that the product and company is innovative and got some funds for that i built 4 versions of prototypes in factory that are all possible to series manufacturer i had a booth at a big gaming event to validate the product i have people on a waitlist wanting to buy the product i have done 3rd party testing on the cases thermal capacity and beat some of the leading cases on the market and some other things i did all of this solo with 0 experience as i told you in the start i am not any super human by any means i am just a delusional guy trying to build what i believe in i am very soon going to market so for you you have not even gave it a try yet its 100 possible will it be difficult yes will you want to give up many many times will you make it only time will tells but you dont know if you dont try the worst that can happen is that you tried you failed you learned a lot and have so much experience just have the grit and will power to keep going one step at the time and one day you will reach your goal but will you reach it in time i dont know you dont know no body knows so why not give it a try,22-12-2024 0:09,Funny_Panic_9212,Reddit,Modeling and Development

ive worked with a bunch of startups as a coach my background is in the military and i found a lot of overlap in the thinking strategy and grit required to succeed in startups during my military service i have worked with a lot of founders that are considered generational or successful and many had the same feelings multiple times in their journeys i have founders from yc spc tf and more that all say the same thing it is hard if it was easy everyone would do it i would say the first thing is breaking down the most important actions you need to take to feel like you are moving forward this is one of the biggest things i coach early stage founders on is seeing through the chaos to find the important,22-12-2024 0:09,Funny_Panic_9212,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
most founders ive seen that fail fall into the solution looking for a problem they come up with an idea they think is cool but it doesnt solve a worthy problem in a different way that customers want i oversee 600 founders now and most of them have this problem but they ignore this first step in startups go talk to real people about the problem first no matter the idea everything can be solved by a proper customer interview here they will tell you if they use the competition but also if there are ways you can beat them they will confirm your ideas or invalidate them quickly customers will motivate you and investors need to see that as well check out the book the mom test requires reading if you want to test ideas before you go too far down the rabbit hole,21-12-2024 21:52,Igjuizdefora_MG,Reddit,Modeling and Development

yes but most likely youll read this comment and then disregard everything i said being an idea guy is akin to being a market researcher sometimes you stumble upon them most time you dont to truly have the right ideas its a lot of work but to validate youve picked the right one today you need to do two things 1 make sure its an ai native product idea read nfx blog on this topic  theyre a vc company 2 if your idea is successful it should change an industry so it likely is in a market worth billions of dollars suddenly not all ideas are equal and after months of jotting them down 10 should fit this category as per the work required to come with such ideas see this twitter thread ,21-12-2024 21:52,Igjuizdefora_MG,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

vp of gtm here so much to unpack here the best thing you cant do is set solid next steps while you are meeting them if other people need to be there get their info and set the call with your current contact and them always try to book your next meeting while on the current meeting if they are unwilling to commit to another meeting there is a bigger issue that no amount of follow up with help with you are about to get ghosted try to make that next meeting as soon as possible that is a good amount of discovery meetings i would kill for that many in a week,21-12-2024 21:23,Fine4FenderFriend,Reddit,Modeling and Development
a few tips based on my own experiences with sales and marketing  always have an action item decided on at the end of the call typically this means scheduling the next meeting while still on the initial call you might get some push back but being a little pushy without being too annoying does work for example when people say ill need to check with person x before moving forward ive said something like ok great i can send you both an invite right now and give you edit permissions in case you need to move it to a time that works for you also feel free to invite anybody else on your end that would be excited about our platform does that sound good to you  drive the conversation for example it sounds like youre still in the very early stages this is typically a good time to get people to sign lois that basically say theyd pay for your product if you built it with features xyz so instead of saying something like would you be willing to sign an loi say something like glad to hear youre excited about what were building for next steps i can send you an loi that lists out your requirements and once you sign that well get to work to solve x problem for you changing my language like this made my discovery calls go so much better it was wild  in terms of following up i typically do 5 followup before i give up though ive heard people have success even up to 10 followups lol the trick is dont just followup saying hey just followingup here always have some new and exciting information to share for example  hey  we just added feature x and helped customer y solve problem z i remember you mentioned in our last call you had the same problem are you up for a quick call so i can tell you more about our new offering  i wouldnt try to capture other information so you can ping them on other channels theyll just get annoyed with you  try more organic channels for example post about your product in subreddits that are relevant to your industry you might get some inbound requests which typically convert at a much higher rate than outbound my dms are always open feel free to ping me if you have any followup questions i love earlystage sales and marketing and i currently help lots of founders find customers on social media,21-12-2024 21:23,Fine4FenderFriend,Reddit,Modeling and Development
been in this exact spot the followup game was killing me until i figured out a system that worked what made the biggest difference having my va handle our entire followup process initially thought itd be impossible to delegate but it transformed our pipeline our current process  va takes detailed notes during calls  sends personalized followup same day  tracks every promised intro and resource  follows up 3x max over 2 weeks  moves to monthly updates after that one thing that worked well recording calls with permission so nothing gets missed makes followups much more specific and meaningful for contact gathering  we just do basic research before calls linkedin  company website usually has everything needed on persistence if no response after 2 weeks we add them to our monthly updates no point burning bridges with aggressive followup happy to share our followup templates if helpful,21-12-2024 21:23,Fine4FenderFriend,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
so the reality here is you need to have your own defined sales process and probably need some upskilling the concept of discovery and follow ups is different for everyone and i think that maybe you havent quite dug deep enough into the what when and why of sales along with the how strongly suggest you set up a standardized process that includes proper information gathering as well as progression so that you arent wasting your time in a bunch of meetings that go nowhere,21-12-2024 21:23,Fine4FenderFriend,Reddit,Critical Thinking
to add on this you need your icp ideal customer persona and that should be the foundation of your platform everything should be done to solve the problem of this person and salles should be done in the same way hi  i have a platform that is able to reduce your costs by x here are some research your sales callsmessages should be super direct and to the point in most cases noone cares what you do they care about what value you can bring them also people looove research papers graphs and everything where they can see real world example you can trial your platform for free with someone and use that data to make a research partnership with x company has reduced their costs by x and then graphs and stats good luck being an entrepreneur never was easy but with internet you at least dont have to leave your house to do something great,21-12-2024 20:28,SoberMister,Reddit,Modeling and Development

not everyone is really ready to work for equity due to their financial commitments even if they are ready they might be having doubts about your startup success since they are investing their time and in return what they get investors are always ready to invest in potential startup so its upto you that you want to give equity or salary you can find students who are interested in startup and onboard them,21-12-2024 19:49,Masony817,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

you dont need to wait for the app to be built to test it id recommend using design tools like figma or canva to create a simple mockup of your app and then animate it into a demo video you can use tools like animoto or lumen5 to turn your static designs into engaging video content that showcases the features you want to highlight this way you validate the idea without wasting time on dev work upfront trust me seeing interest from real people will be a huge motivator to find a tech partner ultimately there is a tool where you can create free waitlist for validation purpose use validate your business idea before you start,21-12-2024 16:18,Stochastic95,Reddit,Modeling and Development

this idea was the first one i came up with when i thought about my own startup pros it helps tech people to skip common tasks and increase productivity cons there are too many alternatives tech people do not like lownocode solutions because they usually lack features and have a common structure that doesnt allow the creation of specific solutions whats most important is that you still need to learn these tools just like any other programming language its completely different if these tools become popular in that case everyone becomes familiar with them and they become more interesting to use than working without them in summary i would say a lowcode tool is a potential and good idea for a startup but it should resonate with developers so they are willing to use your tool instead of creating common tasks manually and of course since this is a fairly straightforward idea there is a huge amount of competition in the lowcode tools market so be prepared for high competition,21-12-2024 10:01,Top_Wonder3876,Reddit,Modeling and Development

capital raising aint easy for most going straight to seed preproduct is often done based on a reputation of prior startup ipo exit or by a team with a unique built product that solves a validated market problem for a significant number of customers who bring big revenue at an inflection point you need a preseed round or friends n family  angel round probably im a vc at a fund that gets involved at the preseed stage but first for me you need to be able to stand on the foundation of a great founding team and vision with the ability to execute and attract talent lois are nice but you still need to prove overall market validation on some level and a big enough market opportunity when you have real traction around long term customer value that seed round becomes easier genai is a crowded space so unique differentiation and strong sustainable competitive advantage are key your teams unique qualifications are a big part of that if you lack the entrepreneurial experience sometimes it helps to have a cofounder who has an exit or two im guessing you and a small team still is missing that experienced cofounder with a startup building track record,21-12-2024 2:06,Trevor050,Reddit,Modeling and Development

creating a remote environment where junior engineers can thrive requires focus intention and a deliberate culture that compensates for the osmosis learning naturally available in physical workplaces without a strong remotefirst culture that the entire team genuinely buys into junior engineers can easily feel lost ramp up more slowly and miss out on critical opportunities for growth ive witnessed this dynamic at multiple companies firsthand and the difference between success and struggle boils down to intentionality here are some foundational practices for fostering a remote culture that supports junior engineers 1 strong documentation culture good documentation isnt just helpfulits essential processes expectations and institutional knowledge need to be clearly written accessible and regularly updated 2 robust onboarding materials new hires should have access to highquality uptodate resources that walk them through everything from tooling to team norms so they dont waste time figuring out the basics on their own 3 transparent communication encourage discussions to happen in shared channels rather than private dms this creates visibility fosters collaboration and ensures that new engineers can passively learn from ongoing conversations 4 structured mentorship assign a mentor or buddy to every junior engineer this gives them a goto person for questions and guidance during their rampup period and establishes a foundation of support 5 peer connections proactively schedule 11s between peers these informal chats can jumpstart meaningful relationships and help engineers feel connected even in a distributed setting 6 periodic inperson meetups remote work doesnt have to mean never meeting in person organize team offsites or companywide gatherings even if only once a year to strengthen bonds and provide those organic serendipitous interactions that are hard to replicate online companies that invest in these practices often find they can attract and nurture young talent providing a strong springboard for engineers development and careers on the other hand organizations that merely offer remote work without building the necessary cultural infrastructure struggle to onboard and retain junior talentor they end up defaulting to hiring only senior engineers who can hit the ground running without additional support the bottom line remote work can be just as effective for growing junior engineers as physical environments but only if companies are intentional about building a culture that enables learning collaboration and connection,21-12-2024 0:00,chase-bears,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring

i acknowledge where youre coming from but i think youre missing a startup perspective in the beginning many founders dont need branding before they build something that is validated and solves a real problem im talking about startups versus a cpg product like a clothing brand many founders use paid ads to test their uvp and gather data on customer acquisition its one of the quickest ways to validate or invalidate a hypothesis branding takes time startups require speed and traction momentum i agree that if founders think they can pay and suddenly build a brand with sales overnight then thats a mistake however reducing the usefulness of paid ads to just branding for startups can lead to the wrong conclusions maybe some other founders here can shed light on how they used paid for initial validation and traction for their startup products,20-12-2024 16:31,Artopedia_1704,Reddit,Modeling and Development
im wonderingif not with ads then how do you build your brand if someones brand doesnt do well on social media not because of the product but because they lack the skill to promote it wouldnt they still need to hire a professional for social media to help build their brand thats still money spent and in a way its still advertising isnt it its very unlikely for a product to sell itself these days nearly every niche is so saturated most gen z buyers it seems dont just buy because of the product but because of the person behind it wouldnt you agree so how do you build your brand if you lack social media skills or the personality for it i understand that is a skillset one can learn by watching some of the success stories on youtube it can take 5 years and some never crack it i guess one will never find out unless they get started,20-12-2024 16:31,Artopedia_1704,Reddit,Modeling and Development
fair point and i agree with the timing on spending money on ads beyond brand building although you can do this with a little budget to learnexperiment however you are likely not talking about a true startup starting a fashion brand and starting a startup is mostly two different things a fashion brand is looking for things like customer segmentsaudience story and optimization of customer acquisition strategy and tactics they mostly do not need to validate some innovative unknown a true startup is about the unknowns with problemsolution fit in the fashion space this is mostly figured out you may need to figure out the productmarket fit to determine if the market is big enough but that is every new business challenge,20-12-2024 16:31,Artopedia_1704,Reddit,Time and Productivity

from your other post it sounds like you already have a product and some users my personal approach is a strong bias for action if i thought i needed another cofounder and thought i had found someone that was a good match i would jump in to executing set expectations that this is a probation on both sides pick a feature that can be shipped in 1 week and work together on building and marketing it for a couple of weeks if it works out you build some trust and understanding of how you work together if not youve each lost a week or two in an unfunded startup i would never let a random angel interview on my behalf and even expert third parties are not going to have the same context as me so what are they filtering for other than technical competence,20-12-2024 15:24,AddendumWeird8789,Reddit,Modeling and Development
think not only about your perspective but also about his what are his interests why does he want to join your team its not just about how skilled he is in development what matters most is his technical vision his approach to development and his ability to communicate effectively with other developers especially since he will be leading the tech team what is his vision for the future of your product do you share the same vision or is he simply following your ideas it might be useful to debate with him on a topic for example take a stance opposite to your real opinion and see how he reacts does he simply agree or does he argue to defend his true position conflicts will inevitably arise in the future so its a good idea to simulate a conflict now observe how you both handle disagreements and whether you can work together effectively despite differing opinions i hope you form a great partnership and create an amazing product together,20-12-2024 15:24,AddendumWeird8789,Reddit,General Discussion

depends on your budget if you want cheap and fast founders use shopify to validate and start making money if you want low barrier with ability to customize more wordpress has a ton of plugins some founders build on top of woo commerce for instance there may be more but its been a while for me the options get more advanced and pricey from there loads of out of the box templates and starting code packages are out there as a starting point every dev has their preference but my advice is to always start cheap and validate first developing a platform and getting an actual market interested are two totally different things too many founders build the solution that doesnt actually solve a problem that customers care about,20-12-2024 12:53,DancinWithWolves,Reddit,Modeling and Development
entrepreneurship is fundamentally a question of culture fueled by capital and handicapped or supported by government its critical to realize its all 3 of those things not just two too many countries make billions available for tech and then scratch their head trying to figure out why they dont have startups and big companies well its because money itself for tech doesnt cause companies whats missing in most of europe is risk tolerance and risk and risk reward i was just in croatia talking about this and they know it money comes from the government and we arent really celebrated for taking risks or failing government regulation which is high in europe and government money available also high reduces entrepreneurship while rewarding funding mediocrity you have fewer angel investors and vcs because why bother government funds things but that means you also have fewer investors expecting returns who have experience and can advise you trust me government officials and university programs are not good startup advisors notice how underlying all of what im pointing out re government investors advisors and even universities being involved is about how things work and why people behave the way they do culture most of the us doesnt even have the culture for it cities try but they too are going about it more like europe isdoes than silicon valley austin has it a bit but local programs and culture misses the mark new york has it a bit but the surrounding focus on research at the big schools stifles it because its the wrong advice about startups ,20-12-2024 12:30,termicrafter16,Reddit,General Discussion

essentially in vc and modern startup markets money wins the us has more money the place where more startups can get the most money wins the vc industry is essentially a natural monopoly market the best startups go to where the best vcs are the best vcs go where the best startups are silicon valley due to historical reasons has built an insurmountable lead a moat something like 95 of the uss advantage is explained by the influence of silicon valley silicon valley is the original moat most startups themselves are looking for monopolies or moats usually what vcs look for is exactly how the startup will build a moat usually they do so from a combination of 1 first mover advantage being first in the market 2 rapid scaling growing operations and marketing faster than competition 3 disruptive product advantage 10x improvement over competition vcs look for companies with high probability of building moats and then provide them maximum funding to maximize the odds of building those moats having more money means silicon valley companies can usually capture the market faster they can outspend competitors in marketing if they lack product capability they can hire talent from competitors or they can even just acquire whole companies to get both the talent and the product europe has plenty of talent plenty of innovation and technology it has a lot of entrepreneurs too a lot of the best us entrepreneurs are originally from europe but europes startups are unable to succeed they either lose or are bought out by us startups or they move to silicon valley vcs and startups in europe arent as confident or ambitious but that is also because they know have an inherent disadvantage and that historically they havent been as successful vcs in europe have less money to invest and have historical worse returns than their us counterparts what can europe do capital markets union and use state funds to outspend the us like crazy that would be the only way to win i find it unlikely to happen frugal states in europe are against the capital markets union and wary of running deficits i honestly believe that regulation is not the major issue,20-12-2024 12:30,termicrafter16,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
im a polish professional who has lived in boston san francisco and now nyc and who works with startups as a fractional cto mentor and service provider ive worked with founders from techstars yc and others somebody mentioned startup culture or lack of it in eu while it is a factor i would never call it the main one the main difference lies in market size and economic structure for context on economy chase a single us bank is larger than the 10 biggest eu banks combined as for market size us boasts a population of 333 million with a unified market and healthy demographics the eu has 450 million people but that population is spread across 27 countries with different languages regulations and fragmented markets this consolidated us market allows vcs and angel investors to take bigger risks even on projects that might fail because the potential rewards are significantly higher additionally the average salary in the us is higher attracting top talent and incentivizing ambitious entrepreneurs to build and scale their startups there in effect the size of investment in startups is significantly higher in us so is the access to resources network talent etc for startups scaling is often much easier in the us thanks to the streamlined regulatory environment greater access to capital and the sheer size of the domestic market in contrast eu startups often face hurdles in expanding across borders due to language barriers regulatory differences and smaller individual markets,20-12-2024 12:30,termicrafter16,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
if i could make one general suggestion to europe it would be to allow people to work remotely in my personal opinion the benefits of having flexibility in my working schedule and cost of living far out weigh any benefits from working in person when a company insists that employees work in the office and yet the fail to make the office a comfortable environment to work its just a waste of resources your people are easily distracted in an open desk environment with no privacy people wander the halls looking for a comfortable place to have a meeting or take a call but spaces are limited and these little phone booth pods are exremely uncomfortable especially for a big guy like myself the food served in the office isnt that great so its a marginal benefit time that could be spend running errands or getting exercise is wasted on commuting or if youre living close to the office the cost of living in the city center is quite high and im simply more productive at home my home is comfortable my office is not,20-12-2024 12:30,termicrafter16,Reddit,Modeling and Development

im high experienced developer who had beed worked as cto in startup yet wasnt cofounder my thoughts about it is cofounder is a person who care about your product because owning a port of it cto  employee who wants to earn or learn that is only about you do you need to someone else who cares about your product except you or you are good yet you need cto in any case since it is a person who not just the most experienced but someone who manage all tech processes from selecting tech stack choosing dev strategy resolving tech conflicts to solving challenges as notech guy you even cant imagine you have problems in your tech until it will be too late and easier to sell company than fix it unfortunately i saw it many times when startups started to seek for cto in moment it is too late as a summary i think any startup must have a cto but not everyone founder must have cofounder if your startup is a tech startup you must be a tech guy or have a tech cofounder only one exception when you do not need cto  if your company is too small less than 10 tech employees and you are going to sell it in near future,20-12-2024 12:14,Important-Koala-3536,Reddit,Modeling and Development

my requirements now for a non technical to partner with me would be  proof of validation  proof that they have put in the effort  proof that they have been talking to potential customers and have a solid stream of communication with them saying have an idea is not enough if you really believed in the idea you would be spending your nights weekends trying to make it happen source ive been that technical partner who believed in the idea and decided to split 5050 and it was one of the worst decisions i made,19-12-2024 21:13,dontworryaboutit41,Reddit,General Discussion

nontechnical founder here while my advice may not be much as youre probably looking for tech folks to respond ill tell you what worked for me when i started my tech startup 6 years ago i stumbled upon a sector that had a high barrier of entry and is very niche and analysed what competitors were offering i reached out to a senior dev from my circle and offered him a substantial equity but he wasnt sold on the idea i then hired a parttime dev paid from my own pocket got the mvp ready in 46 months and pitched to several potential clients after some tweaks and customisations we were able to sell our services to a few and started having recurring revenue while that dev didnt stay for long he wasnt particularly interested in the said industry we were able to find others along the way and have a pretty decent tech team now my tech lead and cto is a great guy and devoted to his job and im lucky to have him he didnt have an illustrious career but he seemed committed smart and honest what more can a person ask for i treat him with respect and try to compensate as best as possible even though we didnt have a great last year financially i ensured he got 100 of his variable salary and his total ctc has risen by around 40 this year he trusted in me when he joined and has been committed to the cause ever since he deserves every bit of his growth bottom line if you have a killer idea or a solid business plan and you cant find someone who believes in the vision and yourself equally find some freelancer get an mvp and try to get an audience make a sale or at least a few pocs get feedback reiterate double down on things it wont be easy but itll be worth it in the end if you put in your 100 believe me feel free to dm if youd like more insights im by no means someone whos figured it all out but i keep on hustling  good luck,19-12-2024 21:13,dontworryaboutit41,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
nearly all attempts fail and as a technical founder i have failed more times then most i value work ethic and accelerated learning i also value being able to disagree with respect to have passion and know how to advocate without dictating i currently work in consulting and operate some smaller ventures on the side to convince me to work on a project requires a lot at this point accepting the amount of work demanded and a persons willingness to do things that are not the fun part is a starting point beyond that these projects could mean the livelihoods of hundreds of people it is a matter of opportunity costs i can work with world class partner technologies where their businesses have already been proven and i dont have to contend with dreamers who want the money without the effort or i can take the risk and work as a technical founder alongside a team and be left with the majority of the work and investment in time capital and intellectual property and fail again eventually i will succeed and i already make enough at my day job to live well in the mean time that being said proving that you are not playing at innovation and are seriously committed for the long nights and the ups and downs that you have the fortitude and consistency isnt something you can easily do in addition very few roles are worth 50 of the company and marketinginvestor relations ceases to be the primary value it is in the beginning once production starts most of the time i work with a smaller team where we each own a share of the profits and certain roles get more shares based on their responsibilities and risk involved in each business where i have made a financial success it has followed this model so i am biased put bluntly education work ethic effort creativity and adaptability are what lead to success personality can only carry you so far and be prepared to watch things fall apart rapidly i would also recommend a book called disciplined entrepreneurship it is a good framework although i tend to seek to exit a venture far faster and with less effort then the process describes every opportunity has to best 300k a year in my pocket and good jobs for 1020 people in minimum scale or it goes on the chopping block it is so easy a filter to look at a market and a sales strategy to see if we had this could we sell it i want my team to be made of millionaires after a few years and any venture that cant achieve this will be sent back to the drawing board i check this well before product or mvp development chances are you want to be the kind of person who can do this work go join a startup work two jobs at the same time to mitigate your risk and do their marketinginvestor work as an early employee once you have done that or while you are doing it make a plan to do your own there is so much you will learn and very quickly you will understand why 99 fail,19-12-2024 21:13,dontworryaboutit41,Reddit,General Discussion

i would highly recommend going for azure over aws the aws credit process is bullshit and they will decline you from getting extra tiers of credits we wasted hundreds of dev hours migrating to aws then switching to azure because aws was being so difficult from what i heard internally azure is kicking their butt and they are trying to reevision their credit system but its probably not going to be very startup friendly azures process is simple and they have good customer service the billing system is a little funky but we easily got 150k when aws fought us for moving above 10k amazon is just a highly greedy company go where youre treated best,19-12-2024 19:50,bilbabay22,Reddit,Products and Economics

depends on a variety of factors also your network if you dont have any background indicative of future success itll take more legwork solo founders are risky youre basically the walking red flag with all those other factors you mentioned if they have all the rest of the boxes checked what makes you as a solo founder special enough to take the risk on to build a team after funding they want to invest in a team that has cohesion and a desire to solve a problem for the next 10 years that being said probably enough traction that it would make sense to take that risk some vcs enjoy the risk depends on who you want to raise from,19-12-2024 17:31,YoKevinTrue,Reddit,General Discussion

sorry to ask what might seem an offtop question why do you want vc  that will create a million times less enjoyment than any cofounder the best possible position is to get customers to fund your investments into product development  ie sell a vision then build it so if you want to spend time building your product  whats stopping you from selling the vision to a few customers and getting paid to build it,19-12-2024 17:31,YoKevinTrue,Reddit,Modeling and Development
while a single founder can be a red flag for many investors it possible to raise if you can show convincing traction this is a good post that gives a view from a vc perspective the first group of traction points founders often reference does little to validate the opportunity set they are building for and as such doesnt yet warrant vc investment this includes signed ndas or lois from potential customers or encouraging conversations with verbal indications of interest in trying a product once it is ready while these can eventually lead to more definitive engagements with potential customers all too often they are simply false signals that ultimately dont lead to any real customer traction the second group of traction points focus around pilots  with key distinctions drawn between paid and nonpaid as well as signed vs deployed generally speaking an unpaid signed pilot is not enough to validate an opportunity but an unpaid pilot that is live with a customer is a solid signal while not yet validating a willingness to pay this pilot establishes engagement metrics and validation of product success across a real customer paid pilots are the first in a sliding scale of traction points that increase the probability of a startups success and also the ability to raise vc s paid pilots will usually ensure a certain degree of buyin from customers which is crucial to running a successful pilot while a signed pilot is a great sign a paid pilot that is live with a customer producing successful metrics and early rabid adopters is the first real chasm to cross in a journey toward product market fit its also the bogey i recommend most founders target ahead of raising vc capital converting a pilot into a fully paid customer and signing contracts with a few other customers is usually plenty of traction to warrant raising a preseed or seed round thats not to say it will ensure it but in the case where a founder is struggling to raise capital it will likely be more the result of other factors like perceived size of market opportunity or foundermarket fit as opposed to a lack of early traction,19-12-2024 17:31,YoKevinTrue,Reddit,Modeling and Development

my opinion and this is coming from someone who has made a switch from employeeship to entrepreneurship you should focus on financial stability first since you are nearing your 40s you must have parents to look after and a marriage in the future but dont ignore your startup either you must build 12 years of emergency funds savings you should have a thick safety net before you quit and also before quitting make sure your startup is generating enough revenue to cover your expenses that way you will be mentally more secure and this way you can follow your passion without running away from your responsibilities like the advice,19-12-2024 11:49,ab_reddit_throwaway,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

starting in a field like mental wellbeing is inspiring and your passion for impact over quick money is a great foundation ive been in your shoes and one thing that helped was validating ideas early there are tools like aicopilot can assist with competitor analysis and market research helping you identify gaps and unique opportunities even in competitive spaces instead of worrying about tech giants focus on starting smallsolve a specific problem for a niche audience and grow from there remember even giants cant cater to everyone and your unique perspective can make a big difference small steps lead to impactful results,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Modeling and Development
id imagine it should be pretty straightforward for you to get some tips from an experienced entrepreneur i know nothing about tech but if a 17 yearold came to me saying they had an idea about the food industry and no idea how to execute id definitely help out while youre learning go to some business events and network with people dont worry about being shy or feeling like you have nothing to offer the ambition and willingness to act at a young age is already great ive run into people who helped me in ways i couldnt image from going to events also reach out to potential mentors or someone who can give you advice online i actually used this exact video as a template for cold outreach and its worked a treat 20 mins  in summary be a human speak to them on a real and personal level and be genuine people want to help people  good luck treat it as a learning experience enjoy the ride,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
physically document every idea that comes into your head whether its good or bad and define what makes it good or bad do your own critical analysis what are the pros and cons of any idea it often take hundreds of repetitions to find one but this exercise is a tried and true pathway to discover what ideas are worth pursuing and which are not for you,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Work and Collaboration
this happens when you have a number of ideas and honestly its a good sign i also struggle from same i did many projects paid freelancers to later discard them just because there were other startups doing the same and i didnt have any moat we have to understand that there are billions of minds like us who also think like us or maybe better than us so coming up with a unique idea is next to impossible but if we build something that is used by even a small group of people thatll be more fulfilling so start whatever you think will add some value to peoples life and stick with it for couple of years,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Modeling and Development
its truly inspiring that at just 17 youre thinking deeply about creating something impactful in the mental wellbeing space your doubts and concerns are validits natural to feel overwhelmed in a rapidly evolving field like technology especially when giants seem to dominate it but let me tell you something every great idea starts with a person who is willing to see a problem differently even if others are working on something similar heres the thing mental wellbeing is a deeply personal and diverse space technology may advance but its the unique perspective empathy and creativity that individuals like you bring to the table that truly make an impact just because something similar exists doesnt mean it addresses every nuance of the problem often the most successful and meaningful solutions arent the first ones but the ones that resonate most deeply with their audience more importantly your age isnt a disadvantageits an asset as part of gen z you understand the challenges your peers face better than most experts your insights into how technology impacts mental health are incredibly valuable combine that with your fresh perspective and youre already ahead in creating something relatable and authentic btw what specific problem in mental wellbeing resonates with you the most and how would you want to use technology to address it even in the simplest form,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Modeling and Development

hey i totally get where youre coming fromit can be tough when every idea seems either too complex or already done but heres the thing even if something similar exists your unique perspective can make a huge difference some of the best products werent the first of their kindthey were better versions or had a unique twist since youre interested in mental wellbeing through technology start by researching real problems people face look into what people complain about on reddit quora or forums related to mental health sometimes the most impactful ideas come from addressing overlooked issues or offering a better user experience also start smallyou dont need a massive launch build a simple version of your idea test it with a few people and see how they respond feedback will guide your next steps shameless plug haha you can try using tools like aidea the app i built you can drop in your rough idea and itll brainstorm things like target audiences market trends competitors strengths and weakness summarize redditquora discussions related to your idea and even suggest ways to validate your concept and build mvp  landing page  the fact that youre thinking deeply about this at 17 shows youre on the right path keep learning stay curious and dont let the fear of competition stop you your unique approach could be exactly what people need ,19-12-2024 11:05,Y_122,Reddit,Modeling and Development

not marketing but sales high commission and very low base saves your cash and reduces your risk you talk equity only after the perform,19-12-2024 7:39,nick-sta,Reddit,Time and Productivity
since you have two years of runway you have some flexibility to explore options if youre hesitant about giving up equity consider starting with freelancers or agencies who specialize in saas marketing they can help you build a foundation seo ppc campaigns content etc without longterm commitment,19-12-2024 7:39,nick-sta,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
depends on how much cash you have and how much time you can spend trying to market yourself or find a good agency going the freelancer route like on upwork can get you some inexpensive heads to start paid digital ads but theyll lack the ability to do creative most of the time if you bring on a marketing partner just make sure they have at least some evidence that theyll be able to get customers for online products before can you share the app name or mssg it,19-12-2024 7:39,nick-sta,Reddit,Critical Thinking

some technical cofounder was saying nontechnical cofounders are useless because they cant build the app so why would they even want 5050 with a technical cofounder maybe you could get another technical cofounder,19-12-2024 7:39,nick-sta,Reddit,General Discussion
i can speak as the nontechnical founder of two startups what you need is from them is business experience sales experience and at least a rudimentary understanding of at least the high level aspects of the technical side they should be more or less the face driving partnerships fundraising and sales at least thats how i run mine i let the brains be the brains and i make the deals,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
i have a slightly different perspective on sales when it comes to a nontechnical founder what im about to say is not to discount early revenuedriving deals but the nontechnical founder is not always synonymous with the future vp of sales whose sole function is driving a client facing sales process for me the non technical founder needs to sell a vision sell a story and be inspiring to recruit a level players to join the team sure thats selling but its not what i think a lot of people here think of when they say do sales the nontechnical founder really needs to be that charismatic face of the company that can inspire confidence in investors employees partners customers and potential employees its far more than running a sales process and getting a contract signed just my little nuanced take fwiw,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,General Discussion
imo the nontechnical founders should drive the customer development process whereas your key responsibility is the product development customer development is about  translating your vision into business model hypotheses ie this is who our customers are this is how we market to them this is who we should partner with this is what the pricing should be etc  testing the hypotheses with potential customers  making sure you have a repeatable and scalable model if theyd be the ceo their main actual work responsibilities should be a making sure your business has money to operate b communicating your vision to the outside world and c hiring people many vcs also emphasize that there should be an industry expert in your founding team so try to check that box unless you yourself are one i dont think that sales should be the main thing your cofounder does customer understanding should be the core if theyre able to help you build the right thing by growing your customer understanding and theyre able to prove it by maybe closing some deals even though they might suck at sales thats a strong signal to you future senior sales candidates and investors that you have something great,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,Modeling and Development
depending on the business it could be their ability to market sell or market and sell also domain knowledge is completely usefulnecessary if in b2b the person talking to people is going to come back with a lot of tech requests,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,Modeling and Development
what i find is that people with exceptional soft skills can articulate techniques they use to master their domains they can decode a soft domain understand what matters to become excellent at it and diligently apply that insight it is much harder to achieve technical mastery of soft skills like networking than hard skills like coding but i find the capacity to achieve mastery of any domain is surprisingly transferable to other domains people who master one thing tend to go on to master other things,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,General Discussion
what ended up mattering the most in your experience there are a whole bunch of things that are necessary but not individually sufficient to make the partnership work none is most and how did you figure out if youre truly compatible before making things official you dont there is risk in a startup but you can save some headaches by  complete a founder compatibility questionnaire very early in the process worry less about personality and more about practical things like personal runway hours equity exit ways of working etc  reach a nonbinding verbal agreement early on about equity pay hours goals metrics when to commit to incorporating and rules for breaking up  dont incorporate until youve been working together for 36 months and there are no red flags take the chance to get out with no messy legal entanglements if its not working 36 months is a good amount of time to work together validating an idea building an mvp getting some traction pitching to vcs and seeing if the idea and the team can work,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,General Discussion
you need to respect what each person brings to the table i may not know how to code but i work rooms and find investment since my work is done at conferences client meetings speaking stuff  it sounds like fun right it is easy for the technical person to think that its not work and they are doing all the work resentment builds its a symbiotic relationship and must be fostered as such i have felt this 100 yes i was in whistler yes i drank smoked ate like a king but i walked out of there with a million in investment they forget the 50 other small events and meetings that led up to that the driving all night to get back red eye flights  and for the record every fn hotel room becomes exactly the same,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,General Discussion

id honestly say a big part of it is their ability to sell and communicate the vision you both have for your startup not just to clients but to all stakeholders and people who are involved with the end user of what youre trying to make finding the right fit is really hard especially when youre alone id say what you have to anticipate especially since youre a technical founder is that hiring is going to be really tough especially with how the job economy is these days so yeah id say that when it comes to joining up with a nontechnical founder you really have to make sure that they have the people skills down to properly bring your business forward after all once you get to that point of scaling which 99 of startups dont make it past making sure that onboarding the right employees will be a big determinant of success there are obvious solutions like learning how to look for hires yourself and trusting your own gut the only problem with this really is that it will consume a lot of your mental energy and effort this is how i did it the first few startups i founded but i eventually realized that after a few times it isnt sustainable to continue that process the solution id recommend is finding a third party that can help do the hiring for you this could be athena or unbound as ive heard about them before my personal choice though is definitely pearl talent as theyve knocked out every single request ive had when it comes to recruiting wish you the best of luck,19-12-2024 5:42,edino525,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration

i listened to a pitch for a single phase to three phase power converter they were going to sell these to rural power companies to enable higher speed charging stations in rural america the converters were something like 175k and they valued themselves at 45m they had no prototype no customers no nothing you can buy a single phase to three phase power converter on amazon for less than 1k today im sure the ones on amazon are bottom of the barrel but the technology already exists so why cant a power utility do this on its own why cant someone use existing technology add some bells and whistles and have something that would work for much less than 175k i was never sure why they thought they were worth 45m i listened to a pitch where there was a self contained ev charger for high density locations office buildings apartments etc for something like 700k per charger an apartment would buy one i dont know the market in new yorks san franciscos etc but why buy these at 700k per charger ive seen some high end apartments and the charging stations were very simplistic and i doubt cost 700k per charger i couldnt understand either pitch,18-12-2024 12:32,Aware-Story6605,Reddit,Modeling and Development

itll depend on what your contract with the other party says unless you enter into a contract that specifically disallows you from doing something like that in the future you can do whatever you want depending on the jurisdiction there might also be limitations on any potential noncompete agreements assuming this is a b2b sale a lawyer can tell you more but given the low sale price youd spend most of it on a lawyer rather quickly this is not legal advice and im not a lawyer,18-12-2024 11:32,mirojoy,Reddit,Critical Thinking

tricky focus without knowing your product or market id say this  stop developing features to enhance user experience for now you dont seem to really need them as youre already growing and receiving positive feedback more features means more maintenance more questions and more support  only develop to reduce support questions this will also be important later when youve grown 10x  focus on sales and marketing learn what channelssegmentsstrategiesfunnels etc work best build the machine that sells and delivers the product delivery of your platform is every bit as important as its functionality when you sell to many small businesses  i guess first hire should be in salesmarketing but i cannot be sure anyway do this create a job description create a traininghandover plan for your new teammember this will tell you if youre ready to effectively employ new hires prepare resources and tools and test them by doing it yourself for a while but not too long build the machine and dont become it good luck and enjoy,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Modeling and Development
there are a number of different issues that could be the deciding factor first of all theres a question of your energy and mental health if you keep pushing yourself at your limits there is a very real risk of burnout related to that is the question of what happens if theres a dip in productivity will the business survive if theres a disruption to its operations if equipment break or a person or two must prioritize something in their personal life can the business stumble and catch up without longterm damage and then theres the question of expansion and growth look at what your vision is for your business a year from now three years five years and compare the required past for that vision with where your business is heading right now are you doing the work today required to achieve your own vision,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Motivation and Inspiration
for me the decision to hire came when i noticed two key things first essential tasks were slipping through the cracks or taking too long to complete and second the opportunity cost of not delegating was holding back growth i evaluated which roles would have the most immediate impactwhether freeing up my time or enhancing the productand started small with contractors or parttime hires to manage risk when your workload begins affecting customer satisfaction or strategic progress its likely time to bring in support to sustain your momentum,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Critical Thinking
my first hire was for customer support it was a nobrainer because i outsourced for 5hour to free up my time on much more important tasks i would recommend you do something similar the only thing youll regret is not doing it sooner,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Modeling and Development

automations can helpbut sooner or later you will need to bring extra human power in order to avoid burnout burnouts are nasty and can bring the whole house down,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Technical Discussions
having been through this exact phase heres what worked for me the key signal to hire is when youre consistently unable to deliver core value to customers due to bandwidth constraints if youre spending most of your time on supportmaintenance rather than building new features or addressing customer needs its time id suggest starting with a technical hire who can take over development freeing you to focus on product vision and growth for customer support consider ai tools first what we did at jenova ai  they can handle a surprising amount of basic inquiries before you need dedicated support staff remember each hire should unlock significantly more value than their cost dont hire just because youre busy  hire when not doing so is actively holding back growth,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Critical Thinking
different perspective before hiring optimize your current situation 1 focus on polishing existing features over rushing new ones  reduces support overhead and lets you focus on core product 2 prioritize network effects and user lockin over feature expansion 3 wait for your jcurve moment  thats when youll have leverage for fundraising and smart hiring until then stay lean and iterate on what works,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Time and Productivity
are you open to the idea of outsourcing the content creation and marketing efforts to a growth agency this can be a costeffective way to see if youre ready for expansion,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,Jobs and Hiring
because youre asking the question you are probably there hire for your weakness and start out part time ive done that with sales and ive done that with devs i knew that wanted to get a little extra cash it also gives you a way to test drive some resources without a long term commitment,18-12-2024 7:22,kay_ceei,Reddit,General Discussion
